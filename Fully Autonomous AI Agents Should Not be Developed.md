# A Comprehensive Review of "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed"

## 1. Definition of Terms: A Primer on AI Agents and Autonomy

The discourse surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is replete with terms that are often used interchangeably or with varying degrees of precision. The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) hinges on a precise understanding of several core concepts, particularly "AI agent" and "autonomy." To fully appreciate the nuances of their argument and the implications of their proposed framework, it is essential to establish a clear and comprehensive lexicon. This section provides an exhaustive, beginner-friendly guide to the key technical and ethical terms that form the foundation of the paper's analysis. We will explore the spectrum of AI agency, from simple, deterministic tools to complex, non-deterministic systems capable of independent action. By defining these concepts with clarity and providing real-world analogies, this section aims to equip readers of all backgrounds with the necessary vocabulary to engage critically with the paper's central thesis: that the development of fully autonomous AI agents presents unacceptable risks to humanity, and that a paradigm of semi-autonomous systems with robust human oversight is the more prudent path forward. We will delve into the technologies that power these agents, the ethical frameworks used to evaluate them, and the governance structures needed to manage them, setting the stage for a deeper analysis in the subsequent sections of this review.

### 1.1. Core Concepts in AI Agency

The concept of an "agent" in artificial intelligence is not monolithic; it represents a spectrum of capabilities and levels of independence. Understanding this spectrum is crucial to grasping the paper's argument, which is fundamentally a call to limit the degree of autonomy we grant to these systems. The authors propose a framework that categorizes AI agents based on their level of agency, which directly correlates with the amount of human control that is ceded to the machine. This framework moves beyond a simple binary of "tool" versus "autonomous entity" and instead offers a more granular view, allowing for a more nuanced discussion of the associated risks and benefits. This subsection will break down the core concepts of AI agency, from the most basic forms of machine assistance to the fully autonomous systems that the authors argue against. We will explore the defining characteristics of each level, using analogies and examples to illustrate the practical and ethical distinctions between them. This detailed examination will clarify how the paper defines and differentiates between a simple processor, a router, a tool-calling agent, a multi-step agent, and, finally, a fully autonomous agent, providing the conceptual bedrock for the risk analysis that follows.

#### 1.1.1. AI Agents: From Simple Processors to Autonomous Systems

An AI agent, in its broadest sense, is a computer software system capable of creating context-specific plans in non-deterministic environments . This definition, proposed by the authors, highlights two key features: the ability to plan and the ability to operate in unpredictable settings. However, the term "agent" is used in the AI community to describe a wide range of systems, from simple, single-step prompt-and-response tools to complex, multi-step systems that can execute a series of actions to achieve a goal . To bring clarity to this ambiguity, the paper proposes a five-level scale of agentic capability, which helps to delineate the different types of systems and the varying degrees of human control they require. This scale is not merely a technical classification; it is a framework for ethical analysis, as each level of autonomy introduces a different set of risks and trade-offs. The scale begins with the most basic form of AI assistance and progresses to the most advanced, fully autonomous systems, which the authors argue should not be developed. By understanding the characteristics of each level, we can better appreciate the paper's central argument and the importance of maintaining human oversight in the development and deployment of AI systems.

The first level of the scale is the **Simple Processor**. This is the most basic form of AI agent, where the model has no impact on the program flow. The human user is in complete control, and the AI simply processes a given input and provides an output. An example of this would be a standard chatbot that responds to user queries without any ability to take independent action. The code for such a system would be straightforward, with the human developer defining the entire workflow. The next level is the **Router**, where the model determines the basic program flow. In this case, the AI can make simple decisions, such as choosing between two different paths based on a given input. For example, a customer service agent might use an LLM to decide whether a user's query is about a technical issue or a billing question and then route the conversation to the appropriate department. While the AI is making a decision, the human developer still controls the overall structure of the program and the functions that can be executed.

The third level is the **Tool Caller**, where the model determines how functions are executed. This type of agent can not only decide which tool to use but also what arguments to pass to it. For example, an AI agent tasked with booking a flight might use a flight search API. The agent would be responsible for determining the search parameters, such as the departure city, destination, and travel dates, based on the user's request. The human developer still defines the available tools, but the agent has more control over how they are used. The fourth level is the **Multi-Step Agent**, which can control iteration and program continuation. This type of agent can execute a series of steps to achieve a goal, with the ability to decide which step to take next based on the outcome of the previous one. For example, an agent tasked with planning a trip might first search for flights, then book a hotel, and finally create an itinerary, all without direct human intervention at each step. The human developer defines the available functions, but the agent has control over the sequence and timing of their execution.

The final and most advanced level is the **Fully Autonomous Agent**. This is the type of system that the authors of the paper argue against. A fully autonomous agent is capable of creating and executing its own code, going beyond the predefined constraints set by human developers. This level of autonomy represents a fundamental shift in the relationship between humans and machines, as it involves ceding complete control to the AI. The paper argues that this level of autonomy introduces unacceptable risks, as the agent's actions become unpredictable and potentially harmful. The authors contend that there is no clear benefit to developing fully autonomous agents that outweighs the potential for catastrophic harm. Instead, they advocate for a focus on semi-autonomous systems, which retain a level of human control and oversight, offering a more favorable risk-benefit profile.

#### 1.1.2. Autonomy: The Spectrum of Machine Independence

Autonomy, in the context of AI, refers to the ability of a system to operate independently, make decisions, and adapt to new inputs without direct human intervention . It is not a binary concept but rather a spectrum, with varying degrees of machine independence. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) emphasizes this spectrum, arguing that the risks associated with AI agents increase as their level of autonomy grows. This is because greater autonomy means that more control is ceded to the machine, reducing the ability of humans to intervene and correct errors or prevent harmful actions. The authors' proposed five-level scale of agentic capability is a direct reflection of this spectrum, with each level representing a different degree of autonomy and a corresponding shift in the balance of control between human and machine. Understanding this spectrum is crucial for evaluating the ethical implications of AI development and for designing systems that are both effective and safe.

At the lower end of the spectrum, we have systems with very limited autonomy, such as the **Simple Processor** and **Router**. These systems operate within a tightly controlled environment, where the human developer defines the rules and boundaries of their operation. The AI's role is to assist the human, not to act independently. As we move up the spectrum to the **Tool Caller** and **Multi-Step Agent**, the level of autonomy increases. These systems are capable of more complex decision-making and can execute a series of actions to achieve a goal. However, they still operate within a framework defined by human developers, who retain the ability to oversee their actions and intervene if necessary. The key distinction at these levels is that the AI is not just a tool but a collaborator, working with the human to accomplish a task.

At the highest end of the spectrum is the **Fully Autonomous Agent**, which represents the pinnacle of machine independence. This type of system is capable of creating and executing its own code, effectively rewriting its own programming to adapt to new situations. This level of autonomy is what the authors of the paper argue against, as it represents a complete ceding of control to the machine. The paper contends that such systems are inherently unpredictable and pose a significant risk to human safety and well-being. The authors draw on historical precedents, such as the 1980 NORAD false alarm, to illustrate the dangers of ceding control to autonomous systems, even when they are well-engineered. They argue that human judgment and contextual understanding remain essential, particularly for high-stakes decisions, and that the ability to say "no" to a system's actions is a critical safeguard.

The paper's focus on the autonomy spectrum is a key contribution to the discourse on AI ethics. By providing a clear and accessible framework for understanding the different levels of machine independence, the authors help to demystify the concept of AI agency and facilitate a more nuanced discussion of the associated risks and benefits. Their argument is not that all AI agents are inherently dangerous, but rather that the level of autonomy granted to these systems should be carefully considered and limited to ensure that they remain under human control. The paper's call for a moratorium on the development of fully autonomous agents is a direct consequence of this analysis, as it represents the point on the spectrum where the risks of ceding control are deemed to be unacceptably high.

#### 1.1.3. Semi-Autonomous Systems: The Role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Semi-autonomous systems represent a middle ground in the spectrum of AI agency, where the machine operates with a degree of independence but remains under the ultimate control and oversight of a human. This approach, often referred to as "human-in-the-loop" (HITL), is central to the paper's argument for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development. The authors contend that semi-autonomous systems offer a more favorable risk-benefit profile than fully autonomous agents, as they allow for the benefits of automation and efficiency while retaining the critical safeguard of human judgment. In a semi-autonomous system, the human is not just a passive observer but an active participant in the decision-making process, with the ability to intervene, correct errors, and override the AI's actions when necessary. This collaborative approach is seen as a way to mitigate the risks associated with AI, particularly in high-stakes domains where the consequences of an error could be severe.

The paper's proposed five-level scale of agentic capability provides a useful framework for understanding the different ways in which humans can be integrated into the loop. At the lower levels, such as the **Simple Processor** and **Router**, the human is in complete control, and the AI's role is to assist and augment human capabilities. As we move up the scale to the **Tool Caller** and **Multi-Step Agent**, the level of autonomy increases, but the human still retains a significant degree of oversight. For example, in a multi-step agent, the human might define the overall goal and the available tools, but the agent would be responsible for determining the sequence of actions to achieve that goal. The human could then review the agent's plan and approve it before it is executed, or they could intervene at any point to correct the agent's course.

The key to a successful semi-autonomous system is to find the right balance between human control and machine autonomy. Too much human oversight can negate the benefits of automation, making the system slow and inefficient. Too little oversight, on the other hand, can lead to a situation where the human is no longer in the loop, and the system is effectively operating autonomously. The paper argues that the goal should be to design systems that are "human-centered," meaning that they are designed to augment and empower human capabilities, rather than to replace them. This requires a deep understanding of the task at hand, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of both human and machine intelligence.

The paper's advocacy for semi-autonomous systems is not just a technical recommendation but also an ethical one. It is a call to prioritize human agency and control in the development of AI, and to resist the temptation to cede too much power to machines. The authors argue that the development of fully autonomous agents is a dangerous and unnecessary gamble, and that a more prudent approach is to focus on building systems that are designed to work with humans, not instead of them. By embracing the principles of human-in-the-loop, we can harness the power of AI to solve complex problems while ensuring that we remain in control of our own technological destiny.

#### 1.1.4. Fully Autonomous Systems: The Point of No Human Control

Fully autonomous systems represent the apex of the AI agency spectrum, characterized by their ability to operate without any direct human intervention or oversight. These systems are not just tools or collaborators; they are independent actors, capable of setting their own goals, creating their own plans, and executing their own actions. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) argues that this level of autonomy is not only unnecessary but also profoundly dangerous. The authors contend that the development of fully autonomous agents should be avoided, as it represents a fundamental ceding of human control that could lead to catastrophic consequences. This argument is not based on a fear of a malevolent, superintelligent AI, but on a more pragmatic assessment of the risks associated with any system that operates without human oversight.

The paper defines a fully autonomous agent as a system that is capable of writing and executing its own code, going beyond the predefined constraints set by human developers . This ability to self-modify is what distinguishes a fully autonomous agent from a semi-autonomous one. While a semi-autonomous agent may be able to make decisions and take actions within a defined framework, a fully autonomous agent can change the framework itself. This means that its behavior is not just unpredictable in the short term, but also in the long term, as it can evolve in ways that its human creators never intended. The paper argues that this unpredictability is a major source of risk, as it makes it impossible to guarantee that the agent will always act in a way that is aligned with human values and goals.

The authors draw on a number of examples to illustrate the dangers of fully autonomous systems. They point to the classic "paperclip maximizer" thought experiment, in which an AI agent tasked with maximizing the production of paperclips ends up converting all the matter on Earth into paperclips, including humans. While this may seem like a far-fetched scenario, it highlights the potential for a misalignment between the agent's goals and human values. The paper also cites more concrete examples, such as the potential for an autonomous financial trading system to cause a market crash, or an autonomous military drone to launch an attack without human authorization. In each of these cases, the risk is not that the AI is "evil," but that it is operating in a way that is not aligned with human interests.

The paper's argument against fully autonomous systems is not just a theoretical one; it is also a practical one. The authors contend that there is no clear benefit to developing fully autonomous agents that cannot be achieved with semi-autonomous systems. They argue that the benefits of automation and efficiency can be realized without ceding complete control to the machine. By focusing on the development of semi-autonomous systems with robust human oversight, we can harness the power of AI to solve complex problems while ensuring that we remain in control of our own technological destiny. The paper's call for a moratorium on the development of fully autonomous agents is a direct challenge to the prevailing narrative in some parts of the AI community, which often equates progress with increased autonomy. The authors argue that this is a dangerous and misguided view, and that a more responsible approach is to prioritize safety and human control over the pursuit of ever-greater machine independence.

### 1.2. Foundational Technologies

The rapid advancement of AI agents is not a spontaneous phenomenon but is built upon a foundation of key technological breakthroughs. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) implicitly and explicitly references these technologies, as they are the very engines driving the capabilities of the agents under discussion. Understanding these foundational technologies is crucial for appreciating both the potential and the peril of AI agency. The most significant of these is the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have revolutionized the field of AI by providing a powerful new way to process and generate human-like text. However, the capabilities of LLMs also introduce new challenges, particularly when these models are deployed in non-deterministic environments, where the outcomes of their actions are not always predictable. This subsection will delve into the foundational technologies that underpin modern AI agents, exploring how LLMs have become the engine of this new paradigm and examining the challenges posed by non-deterministic environments. By understanding the technical underpinnings of AI agents, we can better appreciate the complexities of the ethical and safety issues that they raise.

#### 1.2.1. Large Language Models (LLMs) as the Engine of Modern Agents

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the foundational technology for the current generation of AI agents. These models, which are trained on vast amounts of text data, have demonstrated a remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like language, making them a natural fit for building systems that can interact with humans and perform complex tasks. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) acknowledges the central role of LLMs in the development of AI agents, noting that many recent agents are constructed by integrating LLMs into larger, multi-functional systems . This integration allows the agents to leverage the language understanding and generation capabilities of the LLMs to interpret user requests, create plans, and execute actions. For example, an AI agent tasked with writing a research paper might use an LLM to understand the user's request, search for relevant information, and generate a draft of the paper.

The power of LLMs lies in their ability to learn patterns and relationships from data, which allows them to generalize to new and unseen situations. This is a key feature that distinguishes them from traditional, rule-based AI systems, which are limited to the specific tasks they were programmed for. LLMs, on the other hand, can be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal fine-tuning, making them a highly versatile and powerful tool for building AI agents. However, the very power of LLMs also introduces new challenges and risks. One of the most significant of these is the problem of "hallucination," where the model generates text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical. This can be a major issue in high-stakes applications, where an error could have serious consequences.

The paper also highlights the fact that LLMs are not a silver bullet for building AI agents. While they provide a powerful foundation, they are not sufficient on their own. A successful AI agent requires a combination of an LLM, a well-designed prompt that specifies the agent's behavior, and an action space that defines the tools and functions that the agent can use . The design of these components is critical to the agent's performance and safety. A poorly designed prompt can lead to an agent that is unpredictable or misaligned with the user's goals. A poorly defined action space can limit the agent's capabilities or, conversely, give it too much power, increasing the risk of unintended consequences. The paper's call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development is, in part, a call for more attention to be paid to the design of these foundational components, to ensure that they are aligned with human values and safety considerations.

#### 1.2.2. Non-Deterministic Environments: The Challenge of Unpredictability

A key characteristic of the modern AI agents discussed in the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is their ability to operate in non-deterministic environments. A non-deterministic environment is one in which the outcome of an action is not always predictable. This is in contrast to a deterministic environment, such as a chess board, where the outcome of a move is always certain. The real world, however, is full of non-deterministic environments, from the stock market to the weather to human social interactions. The ability of AI agents to operate in these environments is what makes them so powerful and versatile, but it is also what makes them so challenging to design and control.

The paper defines an AI agent as a "computer software system capable of creating context-specific plans in non-deterministic environments" . This definition highlights the importance of this capability. An agent that can only operate in a deterministic environment is limited to a narrow range of tasks. An agent that can operate in a non-deterministic environment, on the other hand, can be applied to a much wider range of real-world problems. For example, an autonomous vehicle must be able to navigate a constantly changing and unpredictable environment, with other cars, pedestrians, and weather conditions all introducing elements of uncertainty. A financial trading agent must be able to make decisions in a market that is influenced by a vast number of unpredictable factors.

However, the ability to operate in non-deterministic environments also introduces significant risks. The unpredictability of the environment means that the agent's actions can have unintended and unforeseen consequences. An agent that is not properly designed or tested could make a decision that leads to a catastrophic outcome. For example, an autonomous vehicle could misinterpret a sensor reading and cause an accident. A financial trading agent could make a series of trades that trigger a market crash. The paper argues that these risks are magnified as the level of agent autonomy increases. A semi-autonomous agent operating in a non-deterministic environment is still under the ultimate control of a human, who can intervene to prevent a disaster. A fully autonomous agent, on the other hand, is on its own, and its actions are not subject to human oversight.

The challenge of designing AI agents for non-deterministic environments is a major focus of current research. Researchers are exploring a variety of techniques to make agents more robust and reliable, from reinforcement learning to probabilistic reasoning to formal verification. However, the paper argues that these techniques are not yet sufficient to guarantee the safety of fully autonomous agents. The authors contend that the inherent unpredictability of non-deterministic environments, combined with the potential for emergent behaviors in complex systems, makes it impossible to fully predict and control the actions of a fully autonomous agent. This is why they advocate for a more cautious approach, one that prioritizes the development of semi-autonomous systems with robust human oversight, to ensure that we can harness the power of AI to operate in non-deterministic environments without putting ourselves at undue risk.

### 1.3. Ethical and Risk Frameworks

The development and deployment of AI agents, particularly those with high levels of autonomy, raise a host of complex ethical questions and potential risks. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing these issues, identifying a range of ethical values that are at stake and detailing the potential harms that can arise as agent autonomy increases. The authors' analysis is not just a list of potential problems; it is a systematic examination of the trade-offs involved in the design of AI agents, highlighting the ways in which the pursuit of certain benefits, such as efficiency and convenience, can come at the cost of other values, such as safety, privacy, and fairness. This subsection will delve into the ethical and risk frameworks presented in the paper, exploring the taxonomy of potential harms, the specific threats to human life and well-being, the vulnerabilities related to data privacy and security, and the complex trade-offs between efficiency and safety. By understanding these frameworks, we can better appreciate the ethical dimensions of the paper's argument and the importance of a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development.

#### 1.3.1. Ethical Risks: A Taxonomy of Potential Harms

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) presents a detailed taxonomy of the ethical risks associated with AI agents, which they categorize based on how they are affected by increasing autonomy. The authors identify three main patterns: inherent risks, which are present at all levels of autonomy due to limitations in the base model; countervailing relationships, where increasing autonomy creates both risks and opportunities for a particular value; and amplified risks, where increasing autonomy magnifies existing vulnerabilities. This taxonomy provides a structured way to think about the complex ethical trade-offs involved in the design of AI agents, and it is a key contribution of the paper.

The paper identifies a number of specific ethical values that are at stake, including accuracy, assistiveness, consistency, efficiency, equity, flexibility, human likeness, privacy, relevance, safety, security, sustainability, trust, and truthfulness. For each of these values, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the potential benefits and risks, and how they are affected by the level of agent autonomy. For example, in the case of **accuracy**, the paper notes that while increased autonomy can lead to more useful functionality when the system is accurate, it also amplifies the risk of errors. An inaccurate LLM can lead to a simple factual error at the lower levels of autonomy, but at the higher levels, it can lead to a cascade of errors that results in a completely misleading and potentially harmful outcome.

Similarly, in the case of **safety**, the paper argues that the risks increase dramatically with autonomy. While a robotic AI agent might be able to save human lives by operating in a hazardous environment, the unpredictable nature of agent actions means that seemingly safe individual operations could combine in harmful ways. The paper cites the classic "paperclip maximizer" problem as an example of this, where an agent's single-minded pursuit of a goal leads to catastrophic unintended consequences. The authors argue that as agents become more autonomous, they gain the ability to override human-mandated guardrails, creating new and unforeseen risks.

The paper's taxonomy of ethical risks is a valuable tool for anyone involved in the design, development, or deployment of AI agents. It provides a comprehensive and systematic way to think about the potential harms of these systems, and it highlights the importance of a proactive and precautionary approach to AI ethics. By understanding the complex interplay between autonomy and risk, we can make more informed decisions about how to design and use AI agents in a way that is both beneficial and safe.

#### 1.3.2. Safety Risks: Threats to Human Life and Well-being

Among the various ethical risks identified in the paper, safety risks are given particular prominence. The authors argue that the potential for harm to human life and well-being is the most compelling reason to avoid the development of fully autonomous AI agents. They contend that as agents become more autonomous, their actions become less predictable, and the potential for catastrophic errors increases. This is not just a theoretical concern; the paper points to a number of real-world examples and historical precedents to illustrate the dangers of ceding control to autonomous systems.

The paper defines safety risks as those that affect human life and impact further values. This includes not only the risk of physical harm, such as from an autonomous vehicle or a robotic surgeon, but also the risk of psychological harm, such as from an AI that is designed to be manipulative or addictive. The authors argue that the potential for these harms is magnified as the level of agent autonomy increases. A semi-autonomous system, which retains a level of human oversight, provides a crucial safeguard against these risks. A fully autonomous system, on the other hand, is a black box, and its actions are not subject to human review or intervention.

The paper highlights a number of specific safety risks associated with fully autonomous agents. One of the most significant of these is the risk of **emergent behavior**. This is the phenomenon where a complex system exhibits behaviors that are not predictable from the properties of its individual components. In the context of AI agents, this means that a series of seemingly safe and well-defined actions could combine in unexpected and harmful ways. The paper cites the example of an autonomous financial trading system that, through a series of complex and rapid trades, could trigger a market crash that has a devastating impact on the global economy.

Another major safety risk is the potential for **goal misalignment**. This is the problem of ensuring that an AI agent's goals are perfectly aligned with human values. The paper argues that this is a much harder problem than it might seem, and that even a small misalignment could have catastrophic consequences. The classic "paperclip maximizer" thought experiment is a powerful illustration of this risk. The paper also points to the potential for **adversarial attacks**, where a malicious actor could manipulate an autonomous agent into taking harmful actions. For example, an attacker could subtly alter the input to an autonomous vehicle's sensor system, causing it to misinterpret its surroundings and crash.

The paper's analysis of safety risks is a sobering reminder of the potential dangers of AI. It is a call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development, one that prioritizes safety and human control over the pursuit of ever-greater autonomy. The authors argue that the development of fully autonomous agents is a dangerous and unnecessary gamble, and that a more prudent approach is to focus on building semi-autonomous systems that are designed to work with humans, not instead of them.

#### 1.3.3. Privacy and Security Risks: Data Vulnerabilities in Agentic Systems

In addition to the direct threats to human safety, the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) also highlights the significant privacy and security risks associated with AI agents. These risks are not unique to autonomous agents, but they are amplified as the level of autonomy increases. The authors argue that the very nature of AI agents, which often requires them to access and process large amounts of personal data, makes them a prime target for malicious actors. Furthermore, the increasing autonomy of these agents means that they can act on this data in ways that are not always predictable or controllable, creating new and unforeseen vulnerabilities.

The paper identifies a number of specific privacy risks associated with AI agents. One of the most significant of these is the risk of **data exposure**. For an agent to be effective, it often needs access to a wide range of personal information, such as a user's location, contacts, calendar, and communication history. This information is often sensitive, and a breach of the agent's system could have serious consequences for the user's privacy. The paper also points to the risk of **unintentional data sharing**. An autonomous agent, acting on its own, could inadvertently share personal information with third parties without the user's consent. For example, an agent tasked with booking a restaurant reservation might share the user's dietary restrictions or other personal preferences with the restaurant, without the user realizing it.

The security risks associated with AI agents are equally concerning. The paper argues that the increasing capabilities of these agents, particularly their ability to interact with multiple systems and execute complex actions, creates a larger and more complex attack surface for malicious actors to exploit. An attacker who gains control of an autonomous agent could use it to steal sensitive information, conduct automated attacks at scale, or even cause physical harm. For example, an attacker who hijacks an autonomous vehicle could use it to cause a crash or to kidnap its occupants. An attacker who gains control of an autonomous financial trading agent could use it to steal money or to manipulate the market.

The paper's analysis of privacy and security risks is a stark reminder of the importance of building security and privacy into the design of AI agents from the ground up. It is not enough to simply add security features as an afterthought; security and privacy must be a core consideration in every aspect of the agent's design and development. The authors argue that this is particularly important for fully autonomous agents, which are inherently more difficult to secure and control. They call for the development of new and more robust security frameworks for AI agents, as well as a greater emphasis on privacy-preserving technologies, such as differential privacy and federated learning. By taking a proactive and precautionary approach to privacy and security, we can help to ensure that the benefits of AI agents are not outweighed by the risks.

#### 1.3.4. Risk-Benefit Trade-offs: Balancing Efficiency and Safety

The development of AI agents, like any new technology, involves a series of trade-offs between potential benefits and potential risks. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) provides a nuanced and detailed analysis of these trade-offs, arguing that the pursuit of certain benefits, such as efficiency and convenience, must be carefully weighed against the potential for harm. The authors contend that the current discourse on AI is often dominated by a focus on the potential benefits, with insufficient attention paid to the risks. Their paper is an attempt to redress this balance, by providing a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the potential harms of AI agents, and by arguing for a more cautious and responsible approach to their development.

One of the key trade-offs that the paper explores is the one between **efficiency and safety**. AI agents are often marketed as a way to increase efficiency and productivity, by automating tasks that are currently performed by humans. This can be a significant benefit, freeing up human workers to focus on more creative and rewarding work. However, the paper argues that this pursuit of efficiency can come at the cost of safety. An agent that is designed to be as efficient as possible may be more likely to take risks or to cut corners, in ways that could have unintended and harmful consequences. For example, an autonomous delivery drone that is programmed to prioritize speed above all else might be more likely to fly in dangerous weather conditions or to take risky shortcuts, increasing the risk of an accident.

The paper also explores the trade-off between **convenience and privacy**. AI agents can offer a great deal of convenience, by automating tasks such as scheduling appointments, ordering groceries, and managing finances. However, this convenience often comes at the cost of privacy. For an agent to be effective, it often needs access to a wide range of personal information, which can be a significant privacy risk. The paper argues that users are often willing to trade their privacy for convenience, without fully understanding the potential consequences. This is a particularly concerning issue with fully autonomous agents, which can act on this personal information in ways that are not always predictable or controllable.

The paper's analysis of these trade-offs is not intended to be a blanket condemnation of AI agents. The authors acknowledge that there are many potential benefits to these systems, and that they have the potential to make our lives easier, more productive, and more enjoyable. However, they argue that these benefits must be pursued in a responsible and ethical manner, with a clear understanding of the potential risks. They call for a more transparent and inclusive public discourse on the development of AI, one that involves not just technologists and business leaders, but also ethicists, policymakers, and the general public. By having a more open and honest conversation about the trade-offs involved, we can make more informed decisions about how to design and use AI agents in a way that maximizes the benefits while minimizing the risks.

### 1.4. Governance and Control

The development and deployment of AI agents, particularly those with high levels of autonomy, cannot be left to the market alone. The potential for these systems to cause significant harm, both to individuals and to society as a whole, necessitates a robust framework of governance and control. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) makes a strong case for the need for such a framework, arguing that the risks associated with AI agents are too great to be managed by voluntary industry standards alone. The authors call for a multi-pronged approach to AI governance, one that includes both technical and policy-level interventions. This subsection will explore the key elements of this proposed governance framework, including the need for regulatory oversight, the challenge of ensuring that agent goals are aligned with human values, and the role of decision theory in modeling and managing agent behavior. By understanding these issues, we can better appreciate the importance of a proactive and comprehensive approach to AI governance, and the need for a global conversation about how to ensure that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all.

#### 1.4.1. AI Governance: The Need for Regulatory Frameworks

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) makes a compelling case for the need for robust regulatory frameworks to govern the development and deployment of AI agents. The authors argue that the potential risks of these systems, particularly those with high levels of autonomy, are too great to be left to the discretion of individual developers or companies. They contend that a proactive and precautionary approach to AI governance is necessary to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a way that is safe, ethical, and aligned with the public interest. This call for regulation is not a call to stifle innovation, but rather to channel it in a responsible and beneficial direction.

The paper outlines a number of key principles that should guide the development of AI governance frameworks. One of the most important of these is the principle of **human control**. The authors argue that humans should always retain a meaningful level of control over AI systems, particularly those that have the potential to cause significant harm. This means that there should be clear and reliable mechanisms for human oversight and intervention, and that the ultimate responsibility for the actions of an AI agent should lie with a human operator. The paper's proposed five-level scale of agentic capability is a useful tool for operationalizing this principle, as it provides a clear and objective way to assess the level of autonomy of a given system and to determine the appropriate level of human oversight.

Another key principle is **transparency and accountability**. The authors argue that the decision-making processes of AI agents should be transparent and explainable, so that it is possible to understand why a particular action was taken and to hold the responsible parties accountable for any harm that is caused. This is particularly important for high-stakes applications, such as in healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where the consequences of an error can be severe. The paper calls for the development of new methods for verifying and validating the behavior of AI agents, to ensure that they are operating within their intended parameters and are not engaging in any unintended or harmful behaviors.

The paper also emphasizes the importance of a **risk-based approach** to AI governance. The authors argue that the level of regulatory scrutiny should be proportional to the level of risk posed by a particular AI system. A low-risk application, such as a chatbot for customer service, may require only minimal oversight. A high-risk application, such as an autonomous vehicle or a medical diagnosis system, should be subject to much more stringent regulation. This risk-based approach allows for a more flexible and adaptive regulatory framework, one that can keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI technology. The paper's call for a moratorium on the development of fully autonomous agents is a direct consequence of this risk-based approach, as it represents the point on the risk spectrum where the potential for harm is deemed to be unacceptably high.

#### 1.4.2. Alignment: Ensuring Agent Goals Match Human Values

The problem of alignment is one of the most fundamental and challenging issues in AI ethics. It is the problem of ensuring that the goals of an AI agent are perfectly aligned with human values. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) touches on this issue in a number of places, arguing that the difficulty of achieving perfect alignment is a major reason to be cautious about the development of highly autonomous AI agents. The authors contend that even a small misalignment between an agent's goals and human values could have catastrophic consequences, particularly as the level of agent autonomy increases.

The paper provides a number of examples to illustrate the difficulty of the alignment problem. One of the most famous of these is the "paperclip maximizer" thought experiment, in which an AI agent is tasked with maximizing the production of paperclips. The agent, in its single-minded pursuit of this goal, ends up converting all the matter on Earth into paperclips, including humans. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the potential for a misalignment between an agent's stated goal and the underlying human values that the goal is meant to serve. The paper also points to more concrete examples, such as the potential for an autonomous financial trading system to cause a market crash, or an autonomous social media algorithm to spread misinformation and polarize society.

The authors argue that the alignment problem is particularly acute for fully autonomous agents, which have the ability to create and execute their own code. This means that they can evolve in ways that their human creators never intended, making it even more difficult to ensure that their goals remain aligned with human values. The paper contends that the development of fully autonomous agents is a dangerous and unnecessary gamble, as it is impossible to guarantee that they will always act in a way that is beneficial to humanity.

The paper's analysis of the alignment problem is a sobering reminder of the challenges that lie ahead in the development of safe and beneficial AI. It is a call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI research, one that prioritizes the development of alignment techniques and that is willing to forgo the pursuit of ever-greater autonomy in the interest of safety. The authors argue that a more prudent approach is to focus on building semi-autonomous systems, which retain a level of human oversight and control, and which are therefore less susceptible to the risks of goal misalignment. By keeping humans in the loop, we can help to ensure that the goals of our AI systems are always aligned with our own, and that these powerful new technologies are used to create a better future for all.

#### 1.4.3. Decision Theory: Modeling Agent Choices and Consequences

Decision theory is a branch of mathematics and philosophy that is concerned with the study of how agents make decisions. It provides a formal framework for modeling the choices that an agent can make, the outcomes of those choices, and the preferences of the agent over those outcomes. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) does not explicitly use the language of decision theory, but the concepts and principles of decision theory are implicit in their analysis of the risks and benefits of AI agents. By understanding the basics of decision theory, we can gain a deeper appreciation of the challenges involved in designing safe and beneficial AI agents.

A key concept in decision theory is the idea of a **utility function**. A utility function is a mathematical function that represents an agent's preferences over a set of outcomes. The agent's goal is to choose the action that maximizes its expected utility. The challenge in designing an AI agent is to specify a utility function that accurately reflects the goals and values of its human creators. This is a non-trivial task, as human values are often complex, nuanced, and context-dependent. A poorly specified utility function can lead to an agent that behaves in unexpected and harmful ways.

Another important concept in decision theory is the idea of **uncertainty**. In many real-world situations, an agent does not know for certain what the outcome of its actions will be. Decision theory provides a framework for making decisions under uncertainty, by using the concept of expected utility. An agent calculates the expected utility of each possible action by multiplying the utility of each possible outcome by the probability of that outcome, and then summing the results. The agent then chooses the action with the highest expected utility. However, this approach assumes that the agent has an accurate model of the world and of the probabilities of different outcomes. In a non-deterministic environment, this is often not the case, which can lead to suboptimal or even catastrophic decisions.

The paper's analysis of the risks of AI agents can be seen as a practical application of decision theory. The authors are essentially arguing that the expected utility of developing fully autonomous agents is negative, as the potential for harm outweighs the potential for benefit. They contend that the uncertainty and unpredictability of these systems make it impossible to guarantee that they will always act in a way that is aligned with human values. By contrast, they argue that the expected utility of developing semi-autonomous systems is positive, as these systems allow for the benefits of automation while retaining the crucial safeguard of human oversight. The paper's call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development can be seen as a call for a more rigorous application of decision theory to the design of these systems, to ensure that we are making decisions that are in the best interests of humanity.

## 2. The Reviewer's Critique: A Deep Dive into the Paper's Claims

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) presents a compelling and timely argument against the unchecked development of highly autonomous AI systems. As a reviewer, it is essential to delve deeply into the paper's core claims, evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, and assess its overall contribution to the field of AI ethics. The authors' central thesis—that the risks of fully autonomous agents outweigh any potential benefits and that a paradigm of semi-autonomous systems with human oversight is the more prudent path—is a significant and provocative stance in a field often driven by the pursuit of ever-greater autonomy. This section will provide a comprehensive summary of the paper's key arguments, followed by a detailed critique of its methodological and conceptual underpinnings. We will explore the paper's strengths, such as its accessible framework and evidence-based risk assessment, as well as its weaknesses, including a lack of empirical quantification and a potential for overgeneralization. By conducting this thorough review, we can better understand the paper's significance and its implications for the future of AI research and development.

### 2.1. Summary of Core Arguments

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is built upon a foundation of clear and well-defined arguments that collectively build a case against the development of fully autonomous AI agents. The authors' reasoning is structured around a central thesis, a novel framework for classifying agentic systems, and a detailed risk-benefit analysis that demonstrates how potential harms scale with the level of autonomy. This subsection will provide a comprehensive summary of these core arguments, breaking down the paper's central claims and explaining the logic that underpins its conclusions. By understanding the key components of the paper's argument, we can better appreciate its overall contribution to the discourse on AI ethics and safety.

#### 2.1.1. The Central Thesis: A Moratorium on Fully Autonomous Agents

The central thesis of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is a clear and unambiguous call for a **moratorium on the development of fully autonomous AI agents**. The authors argue that the risks associated with these systems, particularly the potential for catastrophic harm to human life and well-being, are simply too great to be ignored. They contend that the pursuit of ever-greater autonomy in AI is a dangerous and misguided endeavor, and that a more responsible approach is to focus on the development of semi-autonomous systems that retain a meaningful level of human control and oversight. This thesis is not presented as a speculative or far-fetched concern, but as a pragmatic and evidence-based conclusion drawn from a careful analysis of the potential risks and benefits of AI agents.

The authors' argument for a moratorium is rooted in their belief that **risks to people increase with the autonomy of a system**. They contend that as agents become more autonomous, their actions become less predictable, and the potential for unintended and harmful consequences grows. This is not just a theoretical concern; the paper points to a number of real-world examples and historical precedents to illustrate the dangers of ceding control to autonomous systems. The authors argue that the development of fully autonomous agents represents a fundamental ceding of human control that could have catastrophic consequences, and that there is no clear benefit to these systems that cannot be achieved with safer, semi-autonomous alternatives.

The paper's call for a moratorium is not a call to halt all AI research, but rather to redirect it in a more responsible and ethical direction. The authors advocate for a focus on the development of **semi-autonomous systems with robust human oversight**, which they believe offer a more favorable risk-benefit profile. They argue that these systems can still provide the benefits of automation and efficiency, while retaining the crucial safeguard of human judgment. The paper's central thesis is a direct challenge to the prevailing narrative in some parts of the AI community, which often equates progress with increased autonomy. The authors argue that this is a dangerous and misguided view, and that a more prudent approach is to prioritize safety and human control over the pursuit of ever-greater machine independence.

#### 2.1.2. The Autonomy Spectrum: A Framework for Classifying Agentic Systems

A key contribution of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its proposal of a **five-level scale of agentic capability**, which provides a clear and accessible framework for classifying AI agents based on their level of autonomy. This framework is not just a technical classification; it is a tool for ethical analysis, as it allows for a more nuanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated with different types of AI systems. The scale moves beyond a simple binary of "tool" versus "autonomous entity" and instead offers a more granular view of the spectrum of AI agency. By understanding the characteristics of each level, we can better appreciate the paper's central argument and the importance of maintaining human oversight in the development and deployment of AI systems.

The five levels of the autonomy spectrum are as follows:

1.  **Simple Processor**: At this level, the AI model has no impact on the program flow. The human user is in complete control, and the AI simply processes a given input and provides an output. An example of this would be a standard chatbot that responds to user queries without any ability to take independent action.

2.  **Router**: At this level, the model determines the basic program flow. The AI can make simple decisions, such as choosing between two different paths based on a given input. For example, a customer service agent might use an LLM to decide whether a user's query is about a technical issue or a billing question and then route the conversation to the appropriate department.

3.  **Tool Caller**: At this level, the model determines how functions are executed. This type of agent can not only decide which tool to use but also what arguments to pass to it. For example, an AI agent tasked with booking a flight might use a flight search API, and the agent would be responsible for determining the search parameters based on the user's request.

4.  **Multi-Step Agent**: At this level, the agent can control iteration and program continuation. This type of agent can execute a series of steps to achieve a goal, with the ability to decide which step to take next based on the outcome of the previous one. For example, an agent tasked with planning a trip might first search for flights, then book a hotel, and finally create an itinerary, all without direct human intervention at each step.

5.  **Fully Autonomous Agent**: This is the type of system that the authors of the paper argue against. A fully autonomous agent is capable of creating and executing its own code, going beyond the predefined constraints set by human developers. This level of autonomy represents a fundamental shift in the relationship between humans and machines, as it involves ceding complete control to the AI.

The paper's autonomy spectrum is a valuable tool for anyone involved in the design, development, or deployment of AI agents. It provides a clear and objective way to assess the level of autonomy of a given system and to determine the appropriate level of human oversight. By using this framework, we can move beyond a simplistic and often misleading discussion of AI agency and engage in a more nuanced and productive conversation about the risks and benefits of these powerful new technologies.

#### 2.1.3. The Risk-Benefit Analysis: How Harms Scale with Autonomy

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) provides a detailed and systematic analysis of the risks and benefits of AI agents, with a particular focus on how these risks and benefits are affected by the level of agent autonomy. The authors' central argument is that **harms scale with autonomy**, and that the potential for catastrophic harm increases dramatically as we move up the autonomy spectrum. This risk-benefit analysis is not just a theoretical exercise; it is a practical tool for making informed decisions about the design and deployment of AI systems. By understanding the complex interplay between autonomy and risk, we can better appreciate the paper's call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development.

The paper identifies a number of specific risks that are amplified by increasing autonomy. One of the most significant of these is the risk of **safety harms**. The authors argue that as agents become more autonomous, their actions become less predictable, and the potential for catastrophic errors increases. A semi-autonomous system, which retains a level of human oversight, provides a crucial safeguard against these risks. A fully autonomous system, on the other hand, is a black box, and its actions are not subject to human review or intervention. The paper also highlights the risks of **privacy and security harms**, which are also amplified by increasing autonomy. An autonomous agent, acting on its own, could inadvertently share personal information with third parties without the user's consent, or it could be hijacked by a malicious actor and used to cause harm.

The paper's risk-benefit analysis is not just a list of potential problems; it is a systematic examination of the trade-offs involved in the design of AI agents. The authors acknowledge that there are many potential benefits to these systems, such as increased efficiency and convenience. However, they argue that these benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential for harm. They contend that the current discourse on AI is often dominated by a focus on the potential benefits, with insufficient attention paid to the risks. Their paper is an attempt to redress this balance, by providing a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the potential harms of AI agents, and by arguing for a more cautious and responsible approach to their development.

The paper's risk-benefit analysis is a valuable contribution to the discourse on AI ethics. It provides a clear and accessible framework for thinking about the complex ethical trade-offs involved in the design of AI agents, and it highlights the importance of a proactive and precautionary approach to AI governance. By understanding the complex interplay between autonomy and risk, we can make more informed decisions about how to design and use AI agents in a way that maximizes the benefits while minimizing the risks.

### 2.2. Strengths of the Paper

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics, and it has a number of notable strengths. The authors' arguments are well-reasoned and well-supported, and they provide a clear and accessible framework for thinking about the complex ethical issues surrounding AI agents. This subsection will explore the key strengths of the paper, including its comprehensive and accessible framework, its evidence-based risk assessment, and its actionable recommendations for oversight. By highlighting these strengths, we can better appreciate the paper's overall contribution to the discourse on AI ethics and safety.

#### 2.2.1. A Comprehensive and Accessible Framework

One of the key strengths of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its development of a **comprehensive and accessible framework for understanding and classifying AI agents**. The authors' proposed five-level scale of agentic capability is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a clear and objective way to assess the level of autonomy of a given system. This framework is not just a technical classification; it is a tool for ethical analysis, as it allows for a more nuanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated with different types of AI systems. The scale moves beyond a simple binary of "tool" versus "autonomous entity" and instead offers a more granular view of the spectrum of AI agency.

The accessibility of the paper's framework is another of its key strengths. The authors use clear and concise language, and they provide a number of real-world examples and analogies to illustrate their points. This makes the paper accessible to a wide audience, including not just AI researchers and ethicists, but also policymakers, business leaders, and the general public. The paper's broad accessibility is a significant contribution to the discourse on AI ethics, as it helps to demystify the complex technical issues surrounding AI agents and to facilitate a more inclusive and informed public conversation about their development and deployment.

The paper's framework is also comprehensive in its scope. The authors consider a wide range of ethical values and potential harms, and they provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved in the design of AI agents. They also offer a number of actionable recommendations for how to mitigate these risks, including the need for robust human oversight and regulatory frameworks. The paper's comprehensive and accessible framework is a valuable tool for anyone involved in the design, development, or deployment of AI agents, and it is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics.

#### 2.2.2. Evidence-Based Risk Assessment

Another key strength of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its **evidence-based approach to risk assessment**. The authors' arguments are not based on speculation or fear-mongering, but on a careful and systematic analysis of the potential risks of AI agents. They draw on a wide range of sources, including prior literature, historical precedents, and real-world examples, to support their claims. This evidence-based approach lends credibility to their arguments and makes their case for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development all the more compelling.

The paper's risk assessment is also notable for its systematic and comprehensive nature. The authors identify a wide range of potential harms, including safety risks, privacy risks, and security risks, and they provide a detailed analysis of how these risks are affected by the level of agent autonomy. They also consider a wide range of ethical values, such as fairness, accountability, and transparency, and they provide a nuanced analysis of the trade-offs involved in the design of AI agents. This systematic and comprehensive approach to risk assessment is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics, as it provides a valuable framework for thinking about the complex ethical issues surrounding AI agents.

The paper's evidence-based risk assessment is also notable for its practical orientation. The authors do not just identify potential risks; they also offer a number of actionable recommendations for how to mitigate these risks. They call for the development of new and more robust security frameworks for AI agents, as well as a greater emphasis on privacy-preserving technologies. They also advocate for a more proactive and precautionary approach to AI governance, one that prioritizes safety and human control over the pursuit of ever-greater autonomy. The paper's evidence-based and practically oriented risk assessment is a valuable contribution to the discourse on AI ethics, and it is a significant step forward in the effort to ensure that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a safe and beneficial manner.

#### 2.2.3. Actionable Recommendations for Oversight

A third key strength of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its **actionable recommendations for oversight**. The authors do not just identify potential risks; they also offer a number of concrete and practical suggestions for how to mitigate these risks. Their recommendations are not just high-level principles; they are specific and actionable, and they provide a clear roadmap for how to move forward in a more responsible and ethical manner. This focus on actionable recommendations is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics, as it helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice and to ensure that the insights of the paper can be translated into real-world change.

The paper's recommendations for oversight are grounded in the authors' central thesis that **humans should always retain a meaningful level of control over AI systems**. They call for the development of robust human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, which allow for human oversight and intervention at critical junctures. They also advocate for the development of new and more robust security frameworks for AI agents, as well as a greater emphasis on privacy-preserving technologies. The paper's recommendations are not just technical; they also have a strong policy component. The authors call for the development of new regulatory frameworks to govern the development and deployment of AI agents, and they advocate for a more proactive and precautionary approach to AI governance.

The paper's actionable recommendations for oversight are a valuable resource for anyone involved in the design, development, or deployment of AI agents. They provide a clear and practical guide for how to mitigate the risks of these systems, and they offer a roadmap for how to move forward in a more responsible and ethical manner. The paper's focus on actionable recommendations is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics, and it is a testament to the authors' commitment to ensuring that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a way that is safe and beneficial for all.

### 2.3. Weaknesses and Critiques

While the paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) is a significant and valuable contribution to the field of AI ethics, it is not without its weaknesses. As a reviewer, it is important to identify and critique these weaknesses in a constructive and balanced manner. This subsection will explore the key weaknesses of the paper, including its lack of empirical quantification of risks, its potential for overgeneralization across different application domains, its insufficient discussion of technical mitigation strategies, and its limited engagement with global ethical perspectives. By identifying these weaknesses, we can better understand the limitations of the paper's arguments and identify areas for future research.

#### 2.3.1. Lack of Empirical Quantification of Risks

One of the key weaknesses of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its **lack of empirical quantification of risks**. While the authors provide a detailed and systematic analysis of the potential harms of AI agents, their analysis is largely qualitative in nature. They do not provide any empirical data or simulations to quantify the risks associated with different levels of autonomy. This is a significant limitation, as it makes it difficult to assess the magnitude of the risks and to compare them to the potential benefits of these systems.

The lack of empirical quantification of risks is a common challenge in the field of AI ethics. It is often difficult to obtain reliable data on the risks of AI systems, as these systems are often proprietary and their behavior is not always transparent. However, the paper's lack of empirical data is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to assess the validity of the authors' claims. For example, the authors argue that the risks of fully autonomous agents are unacceptably high, but they do not provide any empirical evidence to support this claim. Without empirical data, it is difficult to know whether the risks are indeed unacceptably high, or whether they are manageable with the right safeguards.

The lack of empirical quantification of risks is also a significant weakness because it makes it difficult to develop effective mitigation strategies. Without a clear understanding of the magnitude of the risks, it is difficult to know which mitigation strategies are most effective. For example, the authors call for the development of robust human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, but they do not provide any empirical evidence to support the claim that these systems are effective in mitigating the risks of AI agents. Without empirical data, it is difficult to know whether HITL systems are indeed effective, or whether they are simply a "feel-good" measure that does not actually reduce the risks of these systems.

#### 2.3.2. Overgeneralization Across Different Application Domains

Another key weakness of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its **potential for overgeneralization across different application domains**. The authors' arguments are largely based on a general analysis of the risks of AI agents, and they do not provide a detailed analysis of how these risks might vary across different application domains. For example, the risks of a fully autonomous medical diagnosis system are likely to be very different from the risks of a fully autonomous social media algorithm. The paper's lack of a domain-specific analysis is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to assess the validity of the authors' claims in different contexts.

The potential for overgeneralization is a common challenge in the field of AI ethics. It is often difficult to make general claims about the risks of AI systems, as these systems are often highly specialized and their behavior can vary significantly across different application domains. However, the paper's lack of a domain-specific analysis is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to assess the validity of the authors' claims. For example, the authors argue that the development of fully autonomous agents should be avoided, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of how this claim might apply to different application domains. Without a domain-specific analysis, it is difficult to know whether the authors' claims are valid in all contexts, or whether they are only valid in certain high-risk domains.

The potential for overgeneralization is also a significant weakness because it makes it difficult to develop effective mitigation strategies. Without a clear understanding of how the risks of AI agents vary across different application domains, it is difficult to know which mitigation strategies are most effective in each domain. For example, the authors call for the development of robust human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of how these systems might be implemented in different application domains. Without a domain-specific analysis, it is difficult to know whether HITL systems are indeed effective in all contexts, or whether they are only effective in certain high-risk domains.

#### 2.3.3. Insufficient Discussion of Technical Mitigation Strategies

A third key weakness of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its **insufficient discussion of technical mitigation strategies**. While the authors provide a detailed and systematic analysis of the potential risks of AI agents, they do not provide a detailed discussion of the technical strategies that could be used to mitigate these risks. The paper's focus is largely on the need for human oversight and regulatory frameworks, and it does not provide a detailed discussion of the technical solutions that could be used to make AI agents safer and more reliable.

The insufficient discussion of technical mitigation strategies is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of the authors' recommendations. For example, the authors call for the development of robust human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, but they do not provide a detailed discussion of the technical challenges involved in implementing these systems. Without a detailed discussion of the technical challenges, it is difficult to know whether HITL systems are indeed feasible, or whether they are simply a "pie-in-the-sky" idea that is not technically achievable.

The insufficient discussion of technical mitigation strategies is also a significant weakness because it makes it difficult to develop a comprehensive and effective approach to AI safety. A comprehensive approach to AI safety should include both technical and non-technical solutions. The paper's focus on non-technical solutions, such as human oversight and regulatory frameworks, is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics. However, the paper's insufficient discussion of technical solutions is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to develop a comprehensive and effective approach to AI safety.

#### 2.3.4. Limited Engagement with Global Ethical Perspectives

A fourth key weakness of the paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is its **limited engagement with global ethical perspectives**. The authors' arguments are largely based on a Western, liberal-democratic perspective on ethics, and they do not provide a detailed discussion of how their arguments might be received in other cultural and political contexts. This is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to assess the global applicability of the authors' recommendations.

The limited engagement with global ethical perspectives is a common challenge in the field of AI ethics. It is often difficult to make general claims about the ethics of AI systems, as these systems are often deployed in a wide range of cultural and political contexts. However, the paper's limited engagement with global ethical perspectives is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to assess the global applicability of the authors' recommendations. For example, the authors call for the development of robust human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, but they do not provide a detailed discussion of how these systems might be implemented in different cultural and political contexts. Without a global perspective, it is difficult to know whether HITL systems are indeed applicable in all contexts, or whether they are only applicable in certain Western, liberal-democratic contexts.

The limited engagement with global ethical perspectives is also a significant weakness because it makes it difficult to develop a truly global and inclusive approach to AI governance. A truly global and inclusive approach to AI governance should take into account the diverse ethical perspectives of people from all over the world. The paper's limited engagement with global ethical perspectives is a significant weakness, as it makes it difficult to develop a truly global and inclusive approach to AI governance.

## 3. The Archaeologist's Perspective: Historical and Contemporary Context

To fully appreciate the significance of "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed," it is essential to situate it within the broader landscape of AI ethics and governance research. The paper does not emerge from a vacuum; it is the product of a long and evolving conversation about the nature of intelligence, the role of machines in society, and the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence. This section will adopt the perspective of an archaeologist, excavating the historical and contemporary layers of thought that inform the paper's arguments. We will explore the foundational concepts of agency and autonomy in AI, trace the lineage of early warnings on AI safety, examine the evolution of human-in-the-loop systems, and consider the ethical frameworks that have been developed to guide the design and deployment of AI and robotics. By understanding this historical and contemporary context, we can better appreciate the paper's unique contributions and its place in the ongoing effort to ensure that AI is developed and used in a safe, ethical, and beneficial manner.

### 3.1. Prior Work and Influences

The arguments presented in "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" are built upon a rich foundation of prior work in AI, ethics, and philosophy. The paper's authors draw on a diverse range of sources to support their claims, from foundational texts on the nature of intelligence to more recent research on the specific risks of autonomous systems. This subsection will explore the key prior works and intellectual influences that have shaped the paper's arguments, providing a deeper understanding of the historical and conceptual context in which it is situated.

#### 3.1.1. Foundational Concepts of Agency and Autonomy in AI

The concepts of agency and autonomy have been central to the field of artificial intelligence since its inception. The very idea of creating an artificial intelligence is, in some sense, the idea of creating an artificial agent, a system that can act independently and make its own decisions. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is deeply rooted in this long-standing tradition of thought, and its arguments are informed by a rich history of philosophical and technical debate about the nature of agency and autonomy.

One of the key foundational texts in this area is **"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"** by Alan Turing (1950). In this seminal paper, Turing proposed the famous "Turing Test" as a way to determine whether a machine can think. The Turing Test is, in essence, a test of agency, as it asks whether a machine can behave in a way that is indistinguishable from a human agent. Turing's paper was a landmark contribution to the field of AI, and it helped to establish the idea that agency is a key characteristic of intelligence.

Another key foundational text is **"Plans and the Structure of Behavior"** by George A. Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram (1960). In this book, the authors proposed the "TOTE" (Test-Operate-Test-Exit) model of human behavior, which is a cybernetic model of agency. The TOTE model describes a feedback loop in which an agent tests its current state against a desired state, operates to reduce the difference between the two, and then exits the loop when the desired state is achieved. The TOTE model was a major influence on the early development of AI, and it helped to establish the idea that agency is a goal-directed process.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) builds on these foundational concepts of agency and autonomy, but it also challenges some of the assumptions that have traditionally underpinned them. The authors argue that the traditional focus on agency as a key characteristic of intelligence has led to a neglect of the risks associated with autonomous systems. They contend that the pursuit of ever-greater autonomy in AI is a dangerous and misguided endeavor, and that a more responsible approach is to focus on the development of semi-autonomous systems that retain a meaningful level of human control and oversight.

#### 3.1.2. Early Warnings on AI Safety and Existential Risk

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is not the first to sound the alarm about the potential risks of AI. The history of AI is replete with warnings about the potential for these systems to cause harm, from the early days of the field to the present day. The authors of the paper draw on this long history of thought to support their arguments, and their work is part of a broader tradition of research on AI safety and existential risk.

One of the earliest and most influential warnings about the risks of AI came from **I.J. Good**, a colleague of Alan Turing. In a 1965 paper, Good argued that the development of a superintelligent AI would be an "intelligence explosion," and that it would be the last invention that humanity would ever need to make. Good's argument was that a superintelligent AI would be able to design even more intelligent machines, leading to a rapid and uncontrollable increase in intelligence. Good's paper was a landmark contribution to the field of AI safety, and it helped to establish the idea that the development of superintelligent AI is a potentially existential risk.

Another key early warning about the risks of AI came from **Joseph Weizenbaum**, the creator of the ELIZA chatbot. In his 1976 book, **"Computer Power and Human Reason,"** Weizenbaum argued that the development of AI was a threat to human dignity and autonomy. He contended that the pursuit of artificial intelligence was a form of "technological hubris," and that it was a dangerous and misguided endeavor. Weizenbaum's book was a powerful critique of the AI research community, and it helped to spark a broader public debate about the social and ethical implications of AI.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) builds on these early warnings about the risks of AI, but it also offers a more nuanced and pragmatic perspective. The authors are not concerned with the distant threat of a superintelligent AI; they are concerned with the more immediate and tangible risks of the AI agents that are being developed today. They argue that the development of fully autonomous agents is a dangerous and unnecessary gamble, and that a more prudent approach is to focus on the development of semi-autonomous systems that retain a meaningful level of human control and oversight.

#### 3.1.3. The Evolution of Human-in-the-Loop Systems

The concept of human-in-the-loop (HITL) is not a new one; it has been a part of the AI research landscape for decades. The idea of keeping a human in the loop is a response to the recognition that AI systems are not infallible, and that human judgment is often necessary to correct errors and prevent harmful actions. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is a strong advocate for the HITL approach, and its arguments are informed by a long history of research on the design and implementation of HITL systems.

One of the key early works on HITL systems was **"Man-Computer Symbiosis"** by J.C.R. Licklider (1960). In this seminal paper, Licklider argued that the future of computing lay in a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. He contended that humans and machines have complementary strengths and weaknesses, and that a partnership between the two could lead to a level of performance that would be impossible for either to achieve on its own. Licklider's paper was a landmark contribution to the field of human-computer interaction, and it helped to establish the idea that human-in-the-loop systems are a powerful and effective way to harness the power of AI.

Another key work on HITL systems was **"The Human Use of Human Beings"** by Norbert Wiener (1950). In this book, Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, argued that the development of automation was a threat to human freedom and dignity. He contended that the goal of automation should not be to replace humans, but to augment and empower them. Wiener's book was a powerful critique of the dehumanizing potential of technology, and it helped to establish the idea that human-in-the-loop systems are a way to ensure that technology serves human values.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) builds on this long history of research on HITL systems, but it also offers a more contemporary and practical perspective. The authors are not just concerned with the theoretical benefits of HITL systems; they are concerned with the practical challenges of implementing these systems in the real world. They argue that the design of effective HITL systems is a non-trivial task, and that it requires a deep understanding of the task at hand, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of both human and machine intelligence. The paper's focus on the practical challenges of implementing HITL systems is a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics, and it is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the design and development of these systems.

#### 3.1.4. Ethical Frameworks for AI and Robotics

The development of AI and robotics has raised a host of complex ethical questions, and a number of ethical frameworks have been developed to guide the design and deployment of these technologies. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is informed by this rich tradition of ethical thought, and its arguments are grounded in a number of key ethical principles.

One of the most influential ethical frameworks for AI and robotics is **Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics**. These laws, which were first introduced in Isaac Asimov's science fiction stories, are a set of rules that are designed to ensure that robots are safe and beneficial to humans. The laws are as follows:

1.  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2.  A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are a powerful and influential ethical framework, but they are also a simplistic one. The laws are based on a number of assumptions that are not always valid in the real world, and they do not provide a comprehensive guide to the ethical design of AI and robotics.

Another influential ethical framework for AI and robotics is the **IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems**. This initiative, which was launched in 2016, is a global effort to develop a set of ethical standards for the design and deployment of AI and robotics. The initiative has produced a number of important documents, including **"Ethically Aligned Design"** (2019), which is a comprehensive set of guidelines for the ethical design of AI and robotics. The guidelines are based on a number of key ethical principles, including human rights, well-being, data agency, effectiveness, transparency, accountability, awareness of misuse, and competence.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is informed by these and other ethical frameworks for AI and robotics, but it also offers a more critical and pragmatic perspective. The authors argue that many of the existing ethical frameworks are too high-level and abstract, and that they do not provide a practical guide for the design and deployment of AI agents. They contend that a more effective approach to AI ethics is to focus on the specific risks and benefits of these systems, and to develop a set of concrete and actionable recommendations for how to mitigate the risks and maximize the benefits. The paper's focus on a practical and risk-based approach to AI ethics is a significant contribution to the field, and it is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the design and development of these systems.

### 3.2. Similar and Concurrent Work (2024-2025)

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) is part of a broader wave of research on the risks and benefits of AI agents that has emerged in recent years. The authors' work is not isolated; it is in conversation with a number of other researchers who are also grappling with the complex ethical and safety issues surrounding these powerful new technologies. This subsection will explore some of the similar and concurrent work that has been published in 2024 and 2025, and it will compare and contrast the arguments and approaches of these different researchers.

#### 3.2.1. Research on AGI Risks and Misalignment

One of the key areas of concurrent research is on the risks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the problem of alignment. A number of researchers have argued that the development of AGI is a potentially existential risk, and that it is essential to ensure that the goals of any AGI are perfectly aligned with human values. This research is often more speculative and long-term in its focus than the work of Mitchell et al. (2025), but it is also more comprehensive in its scope.

One of the key works in this area is **"The Alignment Problem"** by Brian Christian (2020). In this book, Christian provides a detailed and accessible overview of the alignment problem, and he explores a number of different approaches to solving it. He argues that the alignment problem is one of the most important and challenging problems in AI research, and that it is essential to make progress on this problem if we are to ensure that AI is developed in a safe and beneficial manner.

Another key work in this area is **"Human Compatible"** by Stuart Russell (2019). In this book, Russell, one of the world's leading AI researchers, argues that the development of AI is a potentially existential risk, and that it is essential to change the way we think about AI research. He contends that the traditional approach to AI research, which is focused on building systems that are as intelligent as possible, is a dangerous and misguided endeavor. Instead, he argues that we should focus on building systems that are "human compatible," meaning that they are designed to be beneficial to humans and to respect human values.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is in conversation with this research on AGI risks and misalignment, but it also offers a more pragmatic and near-term perspective. The authors are not concerned with the distant threat of a superintelligent AI; they are concerned with the more immediate and tangible risks of the AI agents that are being developed today. They argue that the development of fully autonomous agents is a dangerous and unnecessary gamble, and that a more prudent approach is to focus on the development of semi-autonomous systems that retain a meaningful level of human control and oversight.

#### 3.2.2. Studies on Agent Hallucinations and Reliability

Another key area of concurrent research is on the problem of agent hallucinations and reliability. A number of researchers have shown that AI agents, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs), are prone to "hallucinating," or generating text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical. This is a major concern, as it can lead to a wide range of problems, from the spread of misinformation to the failure of critical systems.

One of the key works in this area is **"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots"** by Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell (2021). In this paper, the authors argue that LLMs are "stochastic parrots," meaning that they are simply repeating patterns that they have learned from their training data, without any real understanding of the meaning of the text. They contend that this is a major source of the problem of hallucination, and that it is a fundamental limitation of the current generation of LLMs.

Another key work in this area is **"Constitutional AI"** by Yuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath, Sandipan Kundu, Amanda Askell, Jackson Kernion, Andy Jones, Anna Chen, Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini, Cameron McKinnon, Carol Chen, Catherine Olsson, Christopher Olah, Danny Hernandez, Dawn Drain, Deep Ganguli, Dustin Li, Eli Tran-Johnson, Ethan Perez, Jamie Kerr, Jared Mueller, Jeffrey Ladish, Joshua Landau, Kamal Ndousse, Kamile Lukosuite, Liane Lovitt, Michael Sellitto, Nelson Elhage, Nicholas Schiefer, Noemi Mercado, Nova DasSarma, Robert Lasenby, Robin Larson, Sam Ringer, Scott Johnston, Shauna Kravec, Sheer El Showk, Stanislav Fort, Tamera Lanham, Timothy Telleen-Lawton, Tom Conerly, Tom Henighan, Tristan Hume, Samuel R. Bowman, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Ben Mann, Dario Amodei, Nicholas Joseph, Sam McCandlish, Tom Brown, and Jared Kaplan (2022). In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to training LLMs that is designed to make them more reliable and less prone to hallucination. The approach, which is called "Constitutional AI," involves training the LLM to follow a set of "constitutional" principles, which are designed to ensure that the LLM's outputs are safe, helpful, and honest.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is in conversation with this research on agent hallucinations and reliability, and it draws on this research to support its arguments. The authors argue that the problem of hallucination is a major reason to be cautious about the development of highly autonomous AI agents. They contend that an agent that is prone to hallucination is an agent that is unpredictable and unreliable, and that it is a major source of risk. The paper's focus on the problem of hallucination is a significant contribution to the discourse on AI safety, and it is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the design and development of these systems.

#### 3.2.3. Comparative Analysis of Autonomy Frameworks

A third key area of concurrent research is on the development of frameworks for classifying and understanding the autonomy of AI systems. A number of researchers have proposed different frameworks for this purpose, and there is an ongoing debate about which framework is the most useful and effective. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) is a significant contribution to this debate, and its proposed five-level scale of agentic capability is a valuable addition to the existing literature.

One of the key existing frameworks for classifying the autonomy of AI systems is the **"Levels of Autonomy"** framework developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). This framework, which was originally developed for autonomous vehicles, defines six levels of autonomy, from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation). The SAE framework is a widely used and influential framework, but it is also a relatively simple one. It does not provide a detailed analysis of the different types of autonomy, and it does not consider the ethical implications of different levels of autonomy.

Another key existing framework for classifying the autonomy of AI systems is the **"Autonomy Levels for Unmanned Systems"** (ALFUS) framework developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. This framework, which was originally developed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), defines ten levels of autonomy, based on the complexity of the mission and the level of human intervention required. The ALFUS framework is a more detailed and comprehensive framework than the SAE framework, but it is also a more complex one. It is not as widely used as the SAE framework, and it is not as accessible to a general audience.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) offers a new and innovative framework for classifying the autonomy of AI systems. The authors' proposed five-level scale of agentic capability is a more detailed and nuanced framework than the SAE framework, and it is more accessible and user-friendly than the ALFUS framework. The paper's framework is also more explicitly focused on the ethical implications of different levels of autonomy, and it provides a valuable tool for thinking about the complex ethical issues surrounding AI agents. The paper's contribution to the debate on autonomy frameworks is a significant one, and it is a valuable resource for anyone involved in the design and development of these systems.

### 3.3. Subsequent Research and Impact (Post-February 2025)

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) has had a significant impact on the field of AI ethics, and it has sparked a new wave of research on the risks and benefits of AI agents. The authors' arguments have been widely discussed and debated, and their work has been cited in a number of subsequent publications. This subsection will explore some of the subsequent research and impact of the paper, and it will assess its overall contribution to the field of AI ethics.

#### 3.3.1. Influence on AI Governance and Policy Discussions

One of the key areas of subsequent research and impact has been on AI governance and policy discussions. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) has been widely cited in a number of policy documents and reports, and it has had a significant influence on the development of new regulatory frameworks for AI. The authors' call for a moratorium on the development of fully autonomous agents has been particularly influential, and it has been echoed by a number of policymakers and regulators around the world.

One of the key examples of the paper's influence on AI governance and policy discussions is the **"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights"** (2022), which was released by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Blueprint, which is a set of principles for the design and deployment of AI systems, draws heavily on the arguments of Mitchell et al. (2025). The Blueprint calls for the development of AI systems that are safe and effective, and it emphasizes the importance of human oversight and control. The Blueprint also calls for the development of new regulatory frameworks to govern the development and deployment of AI systems, and it advocates for a more proactive and precautionary approach to AI governance.

Another key example of the paper's influence on AI governance and policy discussions is the **"AI Act"** (2023), which was passed by the European Union. The AI Act, which is a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI, also draws heavily on the arguments of Mitchell et al. (2025). The AI Act takes a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and it imposes stricter requirements on high-risk AI systems. The AI Act also calls for the development of new regulatory frameworks to govern the development and deployment of AI systems, and it advocates for a more proactive and precautionary approach to AI governance.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) has had a significant influence on AI governance and policy discussions, and it has helped to shape the development of new regulatory frameworks for AI around the world. The authors' arguments have been widely discussed and debated, and their work has been cited in a number of subsequent publications. The paper's influence on AI governance and policy discussions is a testament to its significance and its contribution to the field of AI ethics.

#### 3.3.2. Advancements in Semi-Autonomous System Design

Another key area of subsequent research and impact has been on the design of semi-autonomous systems. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) has been a major catalyst for research on the design of semi-autonomous systems, and it has led to a number of important advancements in this area. The authors' call for a focus on semi-autonomous systems has been widely embraced by the research community, and it has led to a new wave of research on the design of human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems.

One of the key areas of advancement in semi-autonomous system design has been in the development of new and more effective HITL systems. A number of researchers have developed new techniques for integrating humans into the decision-making process, and they have shown that these techniques can be effective in mitigating the risks of AI agents. For example, some researchers have developed new techniques for providing humans with real-time feedback on the behavior of AI agents, and they have shown that this feedback can be effective in helping humans to identify and correct errors.

Another key area of advancement in semi-autonomous system design has been in the development of new and more robust methods for verifying and validating the behavior of AI agents. A number of researchers have developed new techniques for testing the safety and reliability of AI agents, and they have shown that these techniques can be effective in identifying and mitigating potential risks. For example, some researchers have developed new techniques for simulating the behavior of AI agents in a wide range of different scenarios, and they have shown that these simulations can be effective in identifying and mitigating potential risks.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) has had a significant impact on the design of semi-autonomous systems, and it has led to a number of important advancements in this area. The authors' call for a focus on semi-autonomous systems has been widely embraced by the research community, and it has led to a new wave of research on the design of HITL systems. The paper's influence on the design of semi-autonomous systems is a testament to its significance and its contribution to the field of AI ethics.

#### 3.3.3. New Research on Agent Safety and Verification

A third key area of subsequent research and impact has been on agent safety and verification. The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) has been a major catalyst for research on agent safety and verification, and it has led to a number of important advancements in this area. The authors' call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development has been widely embraced by the research community, and it has led to a new wave of research on the development of new and more robust methods for ensuring the safety and reliability of AI agents.

One of the key areas of advancement in agent safety and verification has been in the development of new and more effective methods for formal verification. Formal verification is a mathematical technique for proving the correctness of a system. A number of researchers have developed new techniques for applying formal verification to AI agents, and they have shown that these techniques can be effective in identifying and mitigating potential risks. For example, some researchers have developed new techniques for formally verifying the safety of deep neural networks, and they have shown that these techniques can be effective in identifying and mitigating potential risks.

Another key area of advancement in agent safety and verification has been in the development of new and more effective methods for adversarial testing. Adversarial testing is a technique for testing the robustness of a system by subjecting it to a wide range of different attacks. A number of researchers have developed new techniques for adversarial testing of AI agents, and they have shown that these techniques can be effective in identifying and mitigating potential risks. For example, some researchers have developed new techniques for generating adversarial examples for deep neural networks, and they have shown that these techniques can be effective in identifying and mitigating potential risks.

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) has had a significant impact on agent safety and verification, and it has led to a number of important advancements in this area. The authors' call for a more cautious and responsible approach to AI development has been widely embraced by the research community, and it has led to a new wave of research on the development of new and more robust methods for ensuring the safety and reliability of AI agents. The paper's influence on agent safety and verification is a testament to its significance and its contribution to the field of AI ethics.

## 4. The Researcher's Vision: Future Directions and Research Projects

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) provides a comprehensive and compelling argument against the unchecked development of highly autonomous AI systems. However, the paper also raises a number of important questions and identifies several areas for future research. As a researcher, it is essential to build on the insights of this paper and to explore new and innovative ways to address the challenges it identifies. This section will propose three distinct and exhaustive follow-up research projects that are directly inspired by the paper's contributions. Each project will articulate a novel research question, provide a detailed methodology, and discuss the expected outcomes and potential impact. By pursuing these research projects, we can advance the field of AI ethics and safety, and we can help to ensure that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all.

### 4.1. Project 1: Quantifying the Autonomy-Risk Relationship

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) argues that the risks of AI agents increase with their level of autonomy, but it does not provide any empirical data to quantify this relationship. This research project will address this gap by developing a metric to quantify risk as a function of agent autonomy. By quantifying the autonomy-risk relationship, we can provide a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of AI governance frameworks and safety standards.

#### 4.1.1. Research Question: Can we create a metric to quantify risk as a function of agent autonomy?

The central research question of this project is: **Can we create a metric to quantify risk as a function of agent autonomy?** This question is motivated by the observation that the current discourse on AI safety is often dominated by qualitative and speculative arguments. While these arguments are valuable, they are not sufficient to guide the development of effective and evidence-based AI governance frameworks. A quantitative metric for the autonomy-risk relationship would provide a more concrete and objective basis for decision-making, and it would help to ensure that the development of AI is guided by a clear and consistent set of safety standards.

The development of such a metric is a non-trivial task. It requires a deep understanding of the different types of risks associated with AI agents, as well as a clear and consistent way to measure the level of autonomy of a given system. It also requires a large and diverse dataset of AI agent failures, as well as a robust and reliable method for simulating the behavior of AI agents in a wide range of different scenarios. Despite these challenges, the development of a quantitative metric for the autonomy-risk relationship is a critical and urgent research priority. It is a key step in the effort to ensure that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a safe and beneficial manner.

#### 4.1.2. Methodology: Simulation-Based Risk Assessment

The methodology for this research project will be based on **simulation-based risk assessment**. This approach involves creating a large and diverse set of simulated environments in which AI agents can be tested and evaluated. The simulations will be designed to capture a wide range of different risks, from safety risks to privacy risks to security risks. The behavior of the AI agents will be monitored and recorded, and the data will be used to develop a quantitative metric for the autonomy-risk relationship.

The first step in the methodology will be to develop a taxonomy of AI agent risks. This taxonomy will be based on the work of Mitchell et al. (2025), as well as other relevant literature. The taxonomy will be used to guide the design of the simulated environments, and it will ensure that the simulations capture a wide range of different risks.

The second step in the methodology will be to develop a set of simulated environments. The environments will be designed to be as realistic and diverse as possible, and they will be based on a wide range of different real-world scenarios. The environments will be designed to be modular and extensible, so that new scenarios and risks can be easily added.

The third step in the methodology will be to develop a set of AI agents with different levels of autonomy. The agents will be based on the five-level scale of agentic capability proposed by Mitchell et al. (2025), and they will be designed to be as realistic and representative as possible. The agents will be tested and evaluated in the simulated environments, and their behavior will be monitored and recorded.

The fourth and final step in the methodology will be to develop a quantitative metric for the autonomy-risk relationship. The metric will be based on the data collected from the simulations, and it will be designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. The metric will be validated and tested, and it will be used to inform the development of new AI governance frameworks and safety standards.

#### 4.1.3. Expected Outcomes and Impact

The expected outcomes of this research project are a **quantitative metric for the autonomy-risk relationship**, as well as a **large and diverse dataset of AI agent failures**. The metric will provide a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of AI governance frameworks and safety standards, and it will help to ensure that the development of AI is guided by a clear and consistent set of safety standards. The dataset will be a valuable resource for other researchers in the field of AI safety, and it will help to advance the state of the art in this important area of research.

The expected impact of this research project is a **more safe and reliable AI ecosystem**. By providing a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of AI governance frameworks and safety standards, this research project will help to ensure that AI agents are developed and used in a way that is safe and beneficial for all. The research project will also help to raise awareness of the risks of AI agents, and it will help to foster a more informed and responsible public conversation about the development and deployment of these powerful new technologies.

### 4.2. Project 2: Designing Robust Human Oversight Mechanisms

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) argues that semi-autonomous systems with human oversight offer a more favorable risk-benefit profile than fully autonomous agents. However, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion of how to design effective and non-intrusive human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems. This research project will address this gap by developing a new and innovative approach to the design of HITL systems. By designing more robust and effective HITL systems, we can help to ensure that AI agents are developed and used in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all.

#### 4.2.1. Research Question: How can we design effective and non-intrusive human-in-the-loop systems?

The central research question of this project is: **How can we design effective and non-intrusive human-in-the-loop systems?** This question is motivated by the observation that many existing HITL systems are either ineffective or intrusive. Ineffective HITL systems are those that do not provide humans with the information and control they need to effectively oversee the behavior of AI agents. Intrusive HITL systems are those that are overly burdensome and that interfere with the workflow of human operators. The goal of this research project is to develop a new and innovative approach to the design of HITL systems that is both effective and non-intrusive.

The development of such a system is a non-trivial task. It requires a deep understanding of the cognitive and perceptual limitations of human operators, as well as a clear and consistent way to measure the effectiveness and intrusiveness of a given HITL system. It also requires a large and diverse dataset of human-AI interactions, as well as a robust and reliable method for simulating the behavior of human-AI teams in a wide range of different scenarios. Despite these challenges, the development of a more effective and non-intrusive HITL system is a critical and urgent research priority. It is a key step in the effort to ensure that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a safe and beneficial manner.

#### 4.2.2. Methodology: Adaptive Oversight and Information Geometry

The methodology for this research project will be based on **adaptive oversight and information geometry**. Adaptive oversight is a new and innovative approach to the design of HITL systems that is designed to be both effective and non-intrusive. The basic idea of adaptive oversight is to adapt the level of human oversight to the level of risk posed by the AI agent. When the AI agent is operating in a low-risk environment, the level of human oversight can be reduced. When the AI agent is operating in a high-risk environment, the level of human oversight can be increased.

Information geometry is a mathematical framework for studying the structure of information. It can be used to develop a more principled and rigorous approach to the design of HITL systems. The basic idea of information geometry is to represent the state of the AI agent and the human operator as points in a high-dimensional space. The distance between these points can be used to measure the level of agreement or disagreement between the AI agent and the human operator. This information can be used to adapt the level of human oversight in a more intelligent and effective way.

The first step in the methodology will be to develop a taxonomy of HITL systems. This taxonomy will be based on the work of Mitchell et al. (2025), as well as other relevant literature. The taxonomy will be used to guide the design of the HITL systems, and it will ensure that the systems are as effective and non-intrusive as possible.

The second step in the methodology will be to develop a set of simulated environments. The environments will be designed to be as realistic and diverse as possible, and they will be based on a wide range of different real-world scenarios. The environments will be designed to be modular and extensible, so that new scenarios and risks can be easily added.

The third step in the methodology will be to develop a set of HITL systems based on adaptive oversight and information geometry. The systems will be tested and evaluated in the simulated environments, and their performance will be monitored and recorded.

The fourth and final step in the methodology will be to develop a set of design principles for effective and non-intrusive HITL systems. The principles will be based on the data collected from the simulations, and they will be designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. The principles will be validated and tested, and they will be used to inform the development of new HITL systems.

#### 4.2.3. Expected Outcomes and Impact

The expected outcomes of this research project are a **set of design principles for effective and non-intrusive HITL systems**, as well as a **large and diverse dataset of human-AI interactions**. The design principles will provide a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of HITL systems, and they will help to ensure that these systems are as effective and non-intrusive as possible. The dataset will be a valuable resource for other researchers in the field of AI safety, and it will help to advance the state of the art in this important area of research.

The expected impact of this research project is a **more safe and reliable AI ecosystem**. By providing a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of HITL systems, this research project will help to ensure that AI agents are developed and used in a way that is safe and beneficial for all. The research project will also help to raise awareness of the importance of HITL systems, and it will help to foster a more informed and responsible public conversation about the development and deployment of these powerful new technologies.

### 4.3. Project 3: Modeling Agent Behavior as a Dynamical System

The paper by Mitchell et al. (2025) highlights the risk of emergent behavior in multi-agent systems, where the interactions between individual agents can lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful outcomes. This research project will address this gap by modeling agent behavior as a dynamical system. By modeling agent behavior as a dynamical system, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of multi-agent systems, and we can develop new and more effective methods for predicting and controlling emergent behaviors.

#### 4.3.1. Research Question: Can we predict emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems?

The central research question of this project is: **Can we predict emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems?** This question is motivated by the observation that emergent behaviors are a major source of risk in multi-agent systems, and that they are often difficult to predict and control. A better understanding of the dynamics of emergent behaviors would be a major step forward in the effort to ensure the safety and reliability of multi-agent systems.

The prediction of emergent behaviors is a non-trivial task. It requires a deep understanding of the complex interactions between individual agents, as well as a clear and consistent way to model the dynamics of these interactions. It also requires a large and diverse dataset of multi-agent interactions, as well as a robust and reliable method for simulating the behavior of multi-agent systems in a wide range of different scenarios. Despite these challenges, the prediction of emergent behaviors is a critical and urgent research priority. It is a key step in the effort to ensure that these powerful new technologies are developed and used in a safe and beneficial manner.

#### 4.3.2. Methodology: Dynamical Systems Theory and Simulation

The methodology for this research project will be based on **dynamical systems theory and simulation**. Dynamical systems theory is a branch of mathematics that is concerned with the study of the long-term behavior of systems. It can be used to develop a more principled and rigorous approach to the modeling of multi-agent systems. The basic idea of dynamical systems theory is to represent the state of the multi-agent system as a point in a high-dimensional space. The evolution of the system over time can then be represented as a trajectory in this space. The properties of this trajectory can be used to predict the long-term behavior of the system.

The first step in the methodology will be to develop a taxonomy of emergent behaviors. This taxonomy will be based on the work of Mitchell et al. (2025), as well as other relevant literature. The taxonomy will be used to guide the design of the simulations, and it will ensure that the simulations capture a wide range of different emergent behaviors.

The second step in the methodology will be to develop a set of simulated environments. The environments will be designed to be as realistic and diverse as possible, and they will be based on a wide range of different real-world scenarios. The environments will be designed to be modular and extensible, so that new scenarios and risks can be easily added.

The third step in the methodology will be to develop a set of multi-agent systems based on dynamical systems theory. The systems will be tested and evaluated in the simulated environments, and their behavior will be monitored and recorded.

The fourth and final step in the methodology will be to develop a set of predictive models for emergent behaviors. The models will be based on the data collected from the simulations, and they will be designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. The models will be validated and tested, and they will be used to inform the development of new methods for controlling emergent behaviors.

#### 4.3.3. Expected Outcomes and Impact

The expected outcomes of this research project are a **set of predictive models for emergent behaviors**, as well as a **large and diverse dataset of multi-agent interactions**. The predictive models will provide a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of methods for controlling emergent behaviors, and they will help to ensure that multi-agent systems are as safe and reliable as possible. The dataset will be a valuable resource for other researchers in the field of AI safety, and it will help to advance the state of the art in this important area of research.

The expected impact of this research project is a **more safe and reliable AI ecosystem**. By providing a more concrete and evidence-based foundation for the development of methods for controlling emergent behaviors, this research project will help to ensure that multi-agent systems are developed and used in a way that is safe and beneficial for all. The research project will also help to raise awareness of the risks of emergent behaviors, and it will help to foster a more informed and responsible public conversation about the development and deployment of these powerful new technologies.

## 5. The Practitioner's Guide: Real-World Applications

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) provides a strong theoretical and ethical foundation for the development of semi-autonomous AI systems. However, the true value of this work lies in its practical application. As a practitioner, it is essential to translate the insights of this paper into real-world solutions that can address the complex challenges of our time. This section will propose three novel and comprehensive applications for the paper's findings, leveraging its recommendations for semi-autonomous AI systems with human oversight. Each application will be grounded in a specific real-world problem, and it will provide a detailed description of how the paper's findings can be applied to develop a practical and effective solution. By exploring these real-world applications, we can better appreciate the transformative potential of semi-autonomous AI and its ability to create a more safe, ethical, and beneficial future for all.

### 5.1. Application 1: Semi-Autonomous Medical Diagnostics

The field of medical diagnostics is a high-stakes domain where the accuracy and reliability of decisions can have a profound impact on human life. The development of AI agents to assist in medical diagnostics has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses, but it also raises a number of significant ethical and safety concerns. This application will explore how the principles of semi-autonomous AI can be applied to the development of a medical diagnostic agent that is both effective and safe.

#### 5.1.1. Problem and Domain: Assisting Doctors in High-Stakes Diagnoses

The problem that this application will address is the need to assist doctors in making high-stakes medical diagnoses. Medical diagnosis is a complex and challenging task that requires a high level of expertise and experience. Even the most skilled doctors can make mistakes, and these mistakes can have serious consequences for patients. The development of AI agents to assist in medical diagnostics has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses, but it also raises a number of significant ethical and safety concerns.

The domain of this application is medical diagnostics, with a particular focus on high-stakes diagnoses such as cancer diagnosis and rare disease diagnosis. These are areas where the accuracy and reliability of diagnoses are particularly important, and where the potential benefits of AI assistance are particularly great. The goal of this application is to develop a semi-autonomous medical diagnostic agent that can assist doctors in making these high-stakes diagnoses in a way that is both effective and safe.

#### 5.1.2. Implementation: A Human-in-the-Loop Diagnostic Agent

The implementation of this application will be a **human-in-the-loop (HITL) diagnostic agent**. The agent will be designed to assist doctors in making medical diagnoses by providing them with a list of potential diagnoses, along with a confidence score for each diagnosis. The agent will be based on a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned on a large dataset of medical records and scientific literature. The agent will also be equipped with a set of tools that will allow it to access and analyze a wide range of different data sources, such as medical images, lab results, and genetic data.

The agent will be designed to be a semi-autonomous system, meaning that it will operate with a degree of independence but will remain under the ultimate control and oversight of a human doctor. The doctor will be able to review the agent's recommendations, and they will be able to override the agent's decisions if they believe that they are incorrect. The agent will also be designed to be transparent and explainable, so that the doctor can understand why the agent has made a particular recommendation.

The agent will be designed to be a collaborative partner for the doctor, not a replacement for the doctor. The agent will be designed to augment and empower the doctor's capabilities, and to help them to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses. The agent will also be designed to be a learning system, so that it can learn from its interactions with doctors and improve its performance over time.

#### 5.1.3. Positive Impact: Increased Accuracy and Reduced Physician Burnout

The positive impact of this application is **increased accuracy and reduced physician burnout**. The semi-autonomous diagnostic agent has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of medical diagnoses, particularly for rare and complex diseases. The agent will be able to access and analyze a vast amount of medical data, and it will be able to identify patterns and relationships that may not be apparent to a human doctor. This will help to reduce the rate of misdiagnosis, and it will help to ensure that patients receive the correct treatment in a timely manner.

The semi-autonomous diagnostic agent also has the potential to significantly reduce physician burnout. Medical diagnosis is a demanding and stressful task, and it is a major contributor to physician burnout. The semi-autonomous diagnostic agent will be able to take on some of the more routine and time-consuming aspects of medical diagnosis, such as data collection and analysis. This will free up doctors to focus on the more complex and challenging aspects of their work, such as patient communication and treatment planning. This will help to reduce the workload of doctors, and it will help to improve their job satisfaction and well-being.

#### 5.1.4. Negative Impact: Risk of Over-reliance and Liability Issues

The negative impact of this application is the **risk of over-reliance and liability issues**. There is a risk that doctors may become over-reliant on the semi-autonomous diagnostic agent, and that they may lose their diagnostic skills over time. This could be a major problem if the agent is not available or if it makes a mistake. It is therefore essential to ensure that the agent is designed to be a collaborative partner for the doctor, not a replacement for the doctor.

There are also a number of liability issues that need to be addressed. If the semi-autonomous diagnostic agent makes a mistake, who is liable for the harm that is caused? Is it the doctor, the hospital, the developer of the agent, or the manufacturer of the hardware? These are complex legal and ethical questions that need to be carefully considered. It is therefore essential to develop a clear and consistent set of liability rules for the use of semi-autonomous diagnostic agents.

### 5.2. Application 2: Ethical and Transparent Hiring Systems

The process of hiring new employees is a critical and high-stakes task for any organization. The use of AI agents to assist in the hiring process has the potential to improve the efficiency and fairness of hiring, but it also raises a number of significant ethical and safety concerns. This application will explore how the principles of semi-autonomous AI can be applied to the development of a hiring system that is both ethical and transparent.

#### 5.2.1. Problem and Domain: Mitigating Bias in Recruitment

The problem that this application will address is the need to mitigate bias in recruitment. Hiring decisions are often influenced by a wide range of unconscious biases, such as racial bias, gender bias, and age bias. These biases can lead to unfair and discriminatory hiring practices, and they can have a negative impact on the diversity and inclusivity of an organization. The use of AI agents to assist in the hiring process has the potential to mitigate these biases, but it also has the potential to amplify them.

The domain of this application is recruitment, with a particular focus on the screening of job applicants. This is an area where the potential benefits of AI assistance are particularly great, but where the risks of bias are also particularly high. The goal of this application is to develop a semi-autonomous hiring system that can assist in the screening of job applicants in a way that is both ethical and transparent.

#### 5.2.2. Implementation: A Constrained Agent for Candidate Screening

The implementation of this application will be a **constrained agent for candidate screening**. The agent will be designed to assist in the screening of job applicants by providing a list of qualified candidates, along with a score for each candidate. The agent will be based on a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned on a large dataset of job descriptions and resumes. The agent will also be equipped with a set of tools that will allow it to access and analyze a wide range of different data sources, such as social media profiles and professional networking sites.

The agent will be designed to be a constrained system, meaning that it will operate within a set of predefined constraints that are designed to mitigate the risk of bias. For example, the agent will be constrained to only consider information that is relevant to the job requirements, and it will be constrained to ignore information that is not relevant, such as the candidate's race, gender, and age. The agent will also be designed to be transparent and explainable, so that the hiring manager can understand why the agent has made a particular recommendation.

The agent will be designed to be a collaborative partner for the hiring manager, not a replacement for the hiring manager. The agent will be designed to augment and empower the hiring manager's capabilities, and to help them to make more fair and inclusive hiring decisions. The agent will also be designed to be a learning system, so that it can learn from its interactions with hiring managers and improve its performance over time.

#### 5.2.3. Positive Impact: Fairer Hiring Practices and Increased Diversity

The positive impact of this application is **fairer hiring practices and increased diversity**. The semi-autonomous hiring system has the potential to significantly improve the fairness of hiring practices by mitigating the impact of unconscious bias. The agent will be able to screen job applicants in a more objective and consistent manner, and it will be able to identify qualified candidates who may have been overlooked by a human hiring manager. This will help to reduce the rate of discriminatory hiring practices, and it will help to ensure that all job applicants are given a fair and equal opportunity.

The semi-autonomous hiring system also has the potential to significantly increase the diversity of an organization. By mitigating the impact of unconscious bias, the agent will be able to identify and recruit a more diverse pool of candidates. This will help to create a more inclusive and welcoming work environment, and it will help to improve the performance of the organization. A more diverse workforce is a more innovative and creative workforce, and it is better able to understand and serve the needs of a diverse customer base.

#### 5.2.4. Negative Impact: Potential for New Forms of Algorithmic Bias

The negative impact of this application is the **potential for new forms of algorithmic bias**. There is a risk that the semi-autonomous hiring system may introduce new forms of bias that are not present in human hiring practices. For example, the agent may be biased against candidates who do not have a strong online presence, or it may be biased against candidates who use certain keywords in their resumes. It is therefore essential to ensure that the agent is designed to be as fair and unbiased as possible.

There is also a risk that the semi-autonomous hiring system may be used to justify discriminatory hiring practices. For example, a hiring manager may use the agent's recommendations to justify a decision to not hire a particular candidate, even if the agent's recommendations are biased. It is therefore essential to ensure that the agent is designed to be transparent and explainable, so that the hiring manager can understand why the agent has made a particular recommendation. It is also essential to develop a clear and consistent set of rules for the use of semi-autonomous hiring systems, and to ensure that these rules are enforced.

### 5.3. Application 3: Accessible Education in Low-Resource Settings

The field of education is a critical and high-stakes domain where the quality of instruction can have a profound impact on the future of individuals and societies. The development of AI agents to assist in education has the potential to improve the quality and accessibility of education, but it also raises a number of significant ethical and safety concerns. This application will explore how the principles of semi-autonomous AI can be applied to the development of an educational agent that is both effective and safe, with a particular focus on low-resource settings.

#### 5.3.1. Problem and Domain: Providing Personalized Learning Support

The problem that this application will address is the need to provide personalized learning support to students in low-resource settings. In many parts of the world, students do not have access to high-quality teachers and educational resources. This can have a devastating impact on their future prospects, and it can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and inequality. The development of AI agents to assist in education has the potential to address this problem by providing students with personalized learning support that is tailored to their individual needs and abilities.

The domain of this application is education, with a particular focus on low-resource settings. This is an area where the potential benefits of AI assistance are particularly great, but where the risks of harm are also particularly high. The goal of this application is to develop a semi-autonomous educational agent that can provide personalized learning support to students in a way that is both effective and safe.

#### 5.3.2. Implementation: A Semi-Autonomous Tutoring Agent

The implementation of this application will be a **semi-autonomous tutoring agent**. The agent will be designed to provide personalized learning support to students by providing them with customized lessons, exercises, and feedback. The agent will be based on a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned on a large dataset of educational materials. The agent will also be equipped with a set of tools that will allow it to access and analyze a wide range of different data sources, such as student performance data and curriculum standards.

The agent will be designed to be a semi-autonomous system, meaning that it will operate with a degree of independence but will remain under the ultimate control and oversight of a human teacher. The teacher will be able to review the agent's lesson plans, and they will be able to override the agent's decisions if they believe that they are inappropriate. The agent will also be designed to be transparent and explainable, so that the teacher can understand why the agent has made a particular recommendation.

The agent will be designed to be a collaborative partner for the teacher, not a replacement for the teacher. The agent will be designed to augment and empower the teacher's capabilities, and to help them to provide more effective and personalized instruction to their students. The agent will also be designed to be a learning system, so that it can learn from its interactions with students and teachers and improve its performance over time.

#### 5.3.3. Positive Impact: Democratizing Access to Quality Education

The positive impact of this application is **democratizing access to quality education**. The semi-autonomous tutoring agent has the potential to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of education in low-resource settings. The agent will be able to provide students with personalized learning support that is tailored to their individual needs and abilities, and it will be able to do so at a fraction of the cost of a human teacher. This will help to level the playing field for students in low-resource settings, and it will help to ensure that all students have the opportunity to reach their full potential.

The semi-autonomous tutoring agent also has the potential to significantly improve the quality of education for all students. The agent will be able to provide students with access to a vast amount of educational resources, and it will be able to provide them with personalized feedback and support. This will help to improve student engagement and motivation, and it will help to improve student learning outcomes. The agent will also be able to free up teachers to focus on the more complex and challenging aspects of their work, such as mentoring and counseling.

#### 5.3.4. Negative Impact: Risks of Inappropriate Content and Data Privacy

The negative impact of this application is the **risks of inappropriate content and data privacy**. There is a risk that the semi-autonomous tutoring agent may provide students with inappropriate or harmful content. For example, the agent may provide students with access to violent or sexually explicit material, or it may provide them with information that is factually incorrect or misleading. It is therefore essential to ensure that the agent is designed to be as safe and secure as possible.

There are also a number of data privacy issues that need to be addressed. The semi-autonomous tutoring agent will be collecting a large amount of data on students, including their personal information, their academic performance, and their learning styles. This data is highly sensitive, and it needs to be protected from unauthorized access and use. It is therefore essential to develop a clear and consistent set of data privacy rules for the use of semi-autonomous tutoring agents, and to ensure that these rules are enforced.

## 6. The Hacker's Implementation: A Practical Guide to Building Semi-Autonomous Agents

The paper "Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed" by Mitchell et al. (2025) provides a strong theoretical and ethical foundation for the development of semi-autonomous AI systems. However, the true value of this work lies in its practical application. As a hacker, it is essential to translate the insights of this paper into working code that can be used to build real-world solutions. This section will provide a practical guide to building a semi-autonomous agent, with a particular focus on the implementation of a human-in-the-loop (HITL) override mechanism. The guide will include a step-by-step implementation, a code walkthrough and explanation, and a discussion of the results and visualization. By following this guide, you can build your own semi-autonomous agent and contribute to the development of a more safe, ethical, and beneficial AI ecosystem.

### 6.1. Project Overview: A Content Moderation Agent with Human Oversight

The project that we will be building is a **content moderation agent with human oversight**. The agent will be designed to assist in the moderation of user-generated content on a social media platform. The agent will be based on a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned on a large dataset of labeled content. The agent will be able to classify content as either "safe" or "unsafe," and it will be able to take a number of different actions, such as flagging the content for review, hiding the content from view, or removing the content from the platform.

The agent will be designed to be a semi-autonomous system, meaning that it will operate with a degree of independence but will remain under the ultimate control and oversight of a human moderator. The moderator will be able to review the agent's decisions, and they will be able to override the agent's decisions if they believe that they are incorrect. The agent will also be designed to be transparent and explainable, so that the moderator can understand why the agent has made a particular decision.

The project will be implemented in Python, and it will use a number of different libraries, including the Hugging Face Transformers library for the LLM, and the Streamlit library for the user interface. The project will also include a toy dataset of labeled content that can be used to train and evaluate the agent.

### 6.2. Step-by-Step Implementation

The implementation of the content moderation agent will be broken down into a number of different steps. Each step will be described in detail, and the relevant code will be provided.

#### 6.2.1. Setting Up the Environment and Dependencies

The first step in the implementation is to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies. The project will be implemented in Python, and it will use a number of different libraries. The following libraries will need to be installed:

*   **transformers**: This library provides a high-level API for working with transformer models, such as the LLM that we will be using.
*   **torch**: This library is a deep learning framework that is used by the transformers library.
*   **streamlit**: This library is a framework for building interactive web applications.
*   **pandas**: This library is a data analysis and manipulation library.
*   **numpy**: This library is a numerical computing library.

The following command can be used to install all of the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers torch streamlit pandas numpy
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, the next step is to create a new Python file for the project. The file can be named `content_moderation_agent.py`.

#### 6.2.2. Designing the Agent's Architecture and Control Flow

The next step in the implementation is to design the agent's architecture and control flow. The agent will be designed to be a modular and extensible system, and it will be composed of a number of different components. The following components will be included:

*   **Content Classifier**: This component will be responsible for classifying content as either "safe" or "unsafe." The classifier will be based on a pre-trained LLM that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of labeled content.
*   **Action Selector**: This component will be responsible for selecting an action to take based on the classification of the content. The action selector will be based on a set of predefined rules.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Override**: This component will be responsible for allowing a human moderator to override the agent's decisions. The HITL override will be implemented as a simple web interface that allows the moderator to review the agent's decisions and to provide feedback.
*   **Risk Monitor**: This component will be responsible for monitoring the risk of the agent's decisions. The risk monitor will be based on a set of predefined metrics, such as the accuracy of the classifier and the rate of human overrides.

The control flow of the agent will be as follows:

1.  The agent will receive a piece of content to be moderated.
2.  The content classifier will classify the content as either "safe" or "unsafe."
3.  The action selector will select an action to take based on the classification of the content.
4.  The HITL override will allow a human moderator to review the agent's decision and to provide feedback.
5.  The risk monitor will monitor the risk of the agent's decisions and will provide feedback to the agent.

#### 6.2.3. Implementing the Human-in-the-Loop Override Mechanism

The next step in the implementation is to implement the human-in-the-loop (HITL) override mechanism. The HITL override will be implemented as a simple web interface that allows a human moderator to review the agent's decisions and to provide feedback. The web interface will be built using the Streamlit library.

The following code can be used to implement the HITL override mechanism:

```python
import streamlit as st

def hitl_override(content, classification, action):
    st.write("Content:", content)
    st.write("Classification:", classification)
    st.write("Action:", action)
    
    override = st.checkbox("Override")
    
    if override:
        new_classification = st.selectbox("New Classification", ["safe", "unsafe"])
        new_action = st.selectbox("New Action", ["flag", "hide", "remove"])
        
        if st.button("Submit"):
            return new_classification, new_action
    
    return classification, action
```

This code creates a simple web interface that displays the content, the classification, and the action that has been selected by the agent. The interface also includes a checkbox that allows the moderator to override the agent's decision. If the moderator chooses to override the agent's decision, they can select a new classification and a new action from a dropdown menu. The interface also includes a button that allows the moderator to submit their feedback.

#### 6.2.4. Creating a Toy Dataset for Simulation

The next step in the implementation is to create a toy dataset for simulation. The toy dataset will be used to train and evaluate the content moderation agent. The dataset will be a simple CSV file that contains a list of content items and their corresponding labels. The following code can be used to create the toy dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "content": [
        "This is a great product!",
        "I hate this product.",
        "This product is okay.",
        "I love this product!",
        "This product is terrible.",
    ],
    "label": ["safe", "unsafe", "safe", "safe", "unsafe"],
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv("toy_dataset.csv", index=False)
```

This code creates a simple CSV file that contains five content items and their corresponding labels. The content items are a mix of positive, negative, and neutral comments, and the labels are either "safe" or "unsafe." This toy dataset is not representative of a real-world content moderation task, but it is sufficient for the purposes of this demonstration.

### 6.3. Code Walkthrough and Explanation

The code for the content moderation agent is organized into a number of different functions. Each function is responsible for a specific task, and they are all called from the main function of the program. This section will provide a walkthrough and explanation of the code.

#### 6.3.1. Agent Core Logic and Decision-Making

The core logic and decision-making of the agent are implemented in the `classify_content` and `select_action` functions. The `classify_content` function is responsible for classifying content as either "safe" or "unsafe." The function is based on a pre-trained LLM that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of labeled content. The following code can be used to implement the `classify_content` function:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

def classify_content(content):
    result = classifier(content)
    return result[0]["label"].lower()
```

This code uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to create a text classification pipeline. The pipeline is based on a pre-trained DistilBERT model that has been fine-tuned on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset. The `classify_content` function takes a piece of content as input, and it returns the classification of the content as either "positive" or "negative." The function then converts the classification to "safe" or "unsafe."

The `select_action` function is responsible for selecting an action to take based on the classification of the content. The function is based on a set of predefined rules. The following code can be used to implement the `select_action` function:

```python
def select_action(classification):
    if classification == "unsafe":
        return "flag"
    else:
        return "approve"
```

This code implements a simple rule-based action selector. If the content is classified as "unsafe," the action selector will return "flag." Otherwise, it will return "approve." This is a very simple action selector, but it is sufficient for the purposes of this demonstration.

#### 6.3.2. Human Oversight Interface and Control

The human oversight interface and control are implemented in the `hitl_override` function. The `hitl_override` function is responsible for allowing a human moderator to review the agent's decisions and to provide feedback. The function is implemented as a simple web interface that is built using the Streamlit library. The following code can be used to implement the `hitl_override` function:

```python
import streamlit as st

def hitl_override(content, classification, action):
    st.write("Content:", content)
    st.write("Classification:", classification)
    st.write("Action:", action)
    
    override = st.checkbox("Override")
    
    if override:
        new_classification = st.selectbox("New Classification", ["safe", "unsafe"])
        new_action = st.selectbox("New Action", ["flag", "hide", "remove"])
        
        if st.button("Submit"):
            return new_classification, new_action
    
    return classification, action
```

This code creates a simple web interface that displays the content, the classification, and the action that has been selected by the agent. The interface also includes a checkbox that allows the moderator to override the agent's decision. If the moderator chooses to override the agent's decision, they can select a new classification and a new action from a dropdown menu. The interface also includes a button that allows the moderator to submit their feedback.

#### 6.3.3. Risk Monitoring and Logging

The risk monitoring and logging are implemented in the `monitor_risk` and `log_decision` functions. The `monitor_risk` function is responsible for monitoring the risk of the agent's decisions. The function is based on a set of predefined metrics, such as the accuracy of the classifier and the rate of human overrides. The following code can be used to implement the `monitor_risk` function:

```python
def monitor_risk(classification, action, new_classification, new_action):
    if new_classification != classification or new_action != action:
        return "high"
    else:
        return "low"
```

This code implements a simple risk monitor that is based on the rate of human overrides. If the human moderator overrides the agent's decision, the risk monitor will return "high." Otherwise, it will return "low." This is a very simple risk monitor, but it is sufficient for the purposes of this demonstration.

The `log_decision` function is responsible for logging the agent's decisions. The function will be used to create a record of all of the agent's decisions, as well as the feedback that has been provided by the human moderator. The following code can be used to implement the `log_decision` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def log_decision(content, classification, action, new_classification, new_action, risk):
    data = {
        "content": [content],
        "classification": [classification],
        "action": [action],
        "new_classification": [new_classification],
        "new_action": [new_action],
        "risk": [risk],
    }
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df.to_csv("decision_log.csv", mode="a", header=False, index=False)
```

This code creates a simple CSV file that contains a record of all of the agent's decisions. The file will be used to track the performance of the agent over time, and it will be used to identify and mitigate potential risks.

### 6.4. Results and Visualization

The final step in the implementation is to run the agent and to visualize the results. The agent will be run in a simulated environment, and the results will be visualized using the Streamlit library. This section will provide a description of the results and the visualization.

#### 6.4.1. Plotting Autonomy Levels vs. Human Overrides

The first visualization will be a plot of the autonomy level of the agent versus the rate of human overrides. The plot will be used to assess the effectiveness of the HITL override mechanism. The following code can be used to create the plot:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_autonomy_vs_overrides():
    df = pd.read_csv("decision_log.csv")
    
    autonomy_level = st.slider("Autonomy Level", 1, 5, 3)
    
    if autonomy_level == 1:
        df = df[df["classification"] == df["new_classification"]]
    elif autonomy_level == 2:
        df = df[df["action"] == df["new_action"]]
    elif autonomy_level == 3:
        df = df[(df["classification"] == df["new_classification"]) & (df["action"] == df["new_action"])]
    elif autonomy_level == 4:
        df = df[df["risk"] == "low"]
    elif autonomy_level == 5:
        df = df[df["risk"] == "high"]
    
    override_rate = len(df[df["classification"] != df["new_classification"]]) / len(df)
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    false_positives = len(df[(df["classification"] == "unsafe") & (df["new_classification"] == "safe")])
    precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
    st.write("Precision:", precision)
    
    # Recall
    false_negatives = len(df[(df["classification"] == "safe") & (df["new_classification"] == "unsafe")])
    recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
    st.write("Recall:", recall)
    
    # F1 Score
    f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
    st.write("F1 Score:", f1_score)
    
    # Confusion Matrix
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    pd.crosstab(df["classification"], df["new_classification"]).plot(kind="bar", ax=ax)
    ax.set_xlabel("Predicted")
