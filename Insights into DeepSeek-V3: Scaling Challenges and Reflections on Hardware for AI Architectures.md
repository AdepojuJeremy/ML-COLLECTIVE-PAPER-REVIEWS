The definitions are designed to be understandable for readers with varying levels of expertise in machine learning and hardware architecture, using analogies and real-world examples to clarify complex ideas. Each term is contextualized to the paper's focus on scaling large language models (LLMs) and the innovations presented in DeepSeek-V3.

### 1.1. Core Concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs)

#### 1.1.1. Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They are characterized by their massive scale, often containing billions or even trillions of parameters, which are the learned weights and biases that define the model's behavior. These models are typically based on the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process and generate text with remarkable fluency and coherence. LLMs are trained on vast datasets of text and code, enabling them to learn the statistical patterns and relationships within language. This training process allows them to perform a wide range of tasks, such as text summarization, translation, question-answering, and creative writing, without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. The rapid scaling of LLMs has led to significant advancements in AI capabilities, but it has also introduced new challenges related to computational cost, memory requirements, and energy consumption. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" focuses on addressing these scaling challenges through a combination of architectural innovations and hardware-aware co-design, aiming to make the development and deployment of LLMs more efficient and cost-effective [^1209^].

The development of LLMs has been a gradual process, with early models like ELMo and BERT paving the way for the more powerful models we see today. The introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 was a major breakthrough, as it enabled the training of much larger and more effective models. Since then, the field has seen a rapid increase in the size and capabilities of LLMs, with models like GPT-3, LLaMA, and DeepSeek-V3 pushing the boundaries of what is possible. This rapid scaling has been driven by a combination of factors, including the availability of larger datasets, more powerful hardware, and new training techniques. However, the increasing size of these models has also led to a number of challenges, including the "AI memory wall," which refers to the growing gap between the memory capacity of hardware and the memory requirements of large models. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" addresses this challenge by introducing a number of innovations, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which are designed to reduce the memory and computational requirements of LLMs without sacrificing performance [^1215^].

#### 1.1.2. The Transformer Architecture

The Transformer architecture is a neural network architecture that was introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. It has since become the dominant architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to process sequential data, such as text, in parallel, which makes it much more efficient than previous architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The core component of the Transformer architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing a particular word. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between words, which is crucial for understanding the meaning of a sentence. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is made up of a stack of identical layers. Each layer contains a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The multi-head self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, which helps it to capture a richer representation of the input. The feed-forward neural network is a simple two-layer network that is applied to each position in the sequence independently. The Transformer architecture has been shown to be highly effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and it has been the foundation for many of the most successful LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek-V3 [^1217^].

The Transformer architecture has undergone a number of modifications and improvements since its introduction. One of the most significant of these is the introduction of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which allows for the creation of much larger models without a proportional increase in computational cost. The MoE architecture works by dividing the model into a number of smaller "expert" networks, and then using a "gating network" to determine which experts to use for a given input. This allows the model to be much more efficient, as it only needs to activate a small subset of the experts for each input. Another important innovation is the use of low-precision training, such as FP8, which can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" builds on these innovations by introducing a number of new techniques, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to further improve the efficiency and scalability of the Transformer architecture [^1215^].

#### 1.1.3. Key-Value (KV) Cache and the "AI Memory Wall"

The Key-Value (KV) cache is a critical component of the Transformer architecture that is used to store the intermediate representations of the input sequence during the attention mechanism. This allows the model to avoid recomputing these representations for each new token that is generated, which can significantly speed up the inference process. However, the size of the KV cache can grow very quickly, especially for long sequences, which can lead to a number of challenges. One of the most significant of these is the "AI memory wall," which refers to the growing gap between the memory capacity of hardware and the memory requirements of large models. As the size of LLMs continues to grow, the size of the KV cache also grows, which can make it difficult to fit the model and the KV cache into the memory of a single GPU. This can lead to a number of performance issues, such as increased latency and reduced throughput. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" addresses this challenge by introducing a new attention mechanism called Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), which is designed to reduce the size of the KV cache without sacrificing performance. MLA works by compressing the key and value vectors into a smaller latent vector, which is then used to compute the attention scores. This can significantly reduce the memory requirements of the KV cache, which can help to alleviate the "AI memory wall" problem [^1211^].

The "AI memory wall" is a major challenge for the continued scaling of LLMs. As the size of these models continues to grow, the memory requirements of the KV cache will also continue to grow, which will make it increasingly difficult to train and deploy these models on existing hardware. This is why innovations like MLA are so important, as they can help to reduce the memory requirements of the KV cache and make it possible to train and deploy larger and more powerful models. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the KV cache and the "AI memory wall," and it presents a number of solutions for addressing this challenge. These solutions include not only MLA, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs. By combining these techniques, the authors of the paper were able to train a 671B parameter model on a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, which is a significant achievement [^1215^].

#### 1.1.4. High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM)

High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a type of fast computer memory that is used in high-performance computing applications, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence accelerators. HBM is designed to provide a very high memory bandwidth, which is the rate at which data can be read from or written to the memory. This is crucial for applications that require a lot of data to be processed quickly, such as training and inference of large language models (LLMs). HBM is typically stacked on top of the processor, which allows for a very short and wide data path between the processor and the memory. This can significantly reduce the latency and increase the bandwidth of the memory, which can lead to a significant improvement in performance. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" discusses the use of HBM in the context of training a large LLM on a cluster of NVIDIA H800 GPUs. The H800 GPUs are equipped with 80GB of HBM3 memory, which provides a memory bandwidth of 3.0 TB/s. This high memory bandwidth is essential for training a large model like DeepSeek-V3, as it allows for the rapid transfer of data between the GPU and the memory, which can significantly reduce the training time [^1219^].

The use of HBM is becoming increasingly important for the training and inference of large LLMs. As the size of these models continues to grow, the memory requirements also grow, which can make it difficult to fit the model and the data into the memory of a single GPU. This is why it is important to use a memory technology like HBM, which can provide a very high memory bandwidth and a large memory capacity. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the use of HBM in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of techniques for optimizing the use of HBM. These techniques include not only the use of a high-performance memory technology like HBM, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs. By combining these techniques, the authors of the paper were able to train a 671B parameter model on a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, which is a significant achievement [^1219^].

### 1.2. Architectural Innovations in DeepSeek-V3

#### 1.2.1. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that allows for the creation of very large models without a proportional increase in computational cost. The MoE architecture works by dividing the model into a number of smaller "expert" networks, and then using a "gating network" to determine which experts to use for a given input. This allows the model to be much more efficient, as it only needs to activate a small subset of the experts for each input. The MoE architecture has been shown to be highly effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and it has been the foundation for many of the most successful LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MoE architecture and its use in the context of training a large LLM. The authors of the paper present a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the MoE architecture, such as an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective. These innovations allow the model to be trained more efficiently and to achieve better performance on a wide range of benchmarks [^1213^].

The MoE architecture is a key component of the DeepSeek-V3 model, which has a total of 671B parameters but only activates 37B parameters per token. This is a significant reduction in computational cost compared to a dense model of the same size, which would need to activate all of its parameters for each token. The MoE architecture also allows the model to be more scalable, as it is possible to add more experts to the model without a proportional increase in computational cost. This is why the MoE architecture is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MoE architecture and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the MoE architecture. These innovations include not only an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1217^].

#### 1.2.2. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)

MLA works by compressing the key and value vectors into a smaller latent vector, which is then used to compute the attention scores. This can significantly reduce the memory requirements of the KV cache, which can help to alleviate the "AI memory wall" problem. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of MLA and its use in the context of training a large LLM. The authors of the paper show that MLA can reduce the size of the KV cache by up to 60 times compared to a standard multi-head attention mechanism, and up to 12 times compared to a grouped query attention mechanism. This is a significant reduction in memory requirements, which can make it possible to train and deploy larger and more powerful models [^1211^].

The MLA mechanism is a key innovation of the DeepSeek-V3 model, and it is one of the main reasons why the model is so efficient. The MLA mechanism is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the standard multi-head attention mechanism, which means that it can be easily integrated into existing Transformer-based models. The MLA mechanism is also designed to be highly efficient, as it only requires a small number of additional parameters to be learned. This is why the MLA mechanism is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MLA mechanism and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the MLA mechanism. These innovations include not only the use of a compressed latent vector, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1215^].

#### 1.2.3. Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)

Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) is a new training objective that was introduced in the paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3." MTP is designed to improve the performance of the model by allowing it to predict multiple tokens at once. This is in contrast to the standard training objective, which only allows the model to predict one token at a time. The MTP objective is designed to be more efficient, as it allows the model to learn more from each training example. The MTP objective is also designed to be more effective, as it allows the model to learn more complex relationships between tokens. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MTP objective and its use in the context of training a large LLM. The authors of the paper show that the MTP objective can significantly improve the performance of the model on a wide range of benchmarks, including code generation and mathematical reasoning. The MTP objective is also designed to be used for speculative decoding, which is a technique that can be used to accelerate the inference process. Speculative decoding works by having the model generate a number of tokens in parallel, and then using a smaller model to verify the correctness of the generated tokens. This can significantly reduce the latency of the inference process, which is crucial for real-time applications [^1213^].

The MTP objective is a key innovation of the DeepSeek-V3 model, and it is one of the main reasons why the model is so efficient. The MTP objective is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the standard training objective, which means that it can be easily integrated into existing Transformer-based models.

This is why the MTP objective is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MTP objective and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the MTP objective.

### 1.3. Hardware-Aware Co-Design and Optimization

#### 1.3.1. Hardware-Aware Co-Design

Hardware-aware co-design is a design methodology that involves the simultaneous design of both the hardware and the software for a particular application. This is in contrast to the traditional design methodology, which involves the design of the hardware and the software in separate stages. The hardware-aware co-design methodology is designed to be more efficient, as it allows for the optimization of both the hardware and the software for a particular application. The hardware-aware co-design methodology is also designed to be more effective, as it allows for the creation of more powerful and efficient systems.

#### 1.3.2. FP8 Mixed-Precision Training

FP8 mixed-precision training is a training technique that uses a combination of 8-bit floating-point (FP8) and 16-bit floating-point (FP16) or 32-bit floating-point (FP32) arithmetic to train a neural network. The use of FP8 arithmetic can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model, as it requires less memory to store the model's parameters and gradients, and it can be computed more quickly than FP16 or FP32 arithmetic. However, the use of FP8 arithmetic can also lead to a loss of precision, which can negatively impact the performance of the model. To mitigate this, FP8 mixed-precision training uses a combination of FP8 and FP16 or FP32 arithmetic. The model's parameters and gradients are stored in FP8, but the computations are performed in FP16 or FP32. This allows the model to benefit from the reduced memory and computational requirements of FP8, while still maintaining the precision of FP16 or FP32.

#### 1.4.3. Low-Precision Computing

Low-Precision Computing is a computing technique that uses a lower precision for the representation of numbers than the standard 32-bit floating-point (FP32) or 16-bit floating-point (FP16) precision. The use of a lower precision can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of a computation, as it requires less memory to store the numbers and it can be computed more quickly than a higher precision. However, the use of a lower precision can also lead to a loss of precision, which can negatively impact the performance of the computation. To mitigate this, low-precision computing techniques often use a combination of low-precision and high-precision arithmetic. The numbers are stored in a low-precision format, but the computations are performed in a high-precision format. This allows the computation to benefit from the reduced memory and computational requirements of a low-precision format, while still maintaining the precision of a high-precision format.

These innovations include not only the use of a tile-wise and block-wise quantization scheme, but also a number of other techniques, such as a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1220^].

#### 1.4.4. Scale-Up vs. Scale-Out

Scale-Up and Scale-Out are two different approaches to scaling a computing system. Scale-Up involves increasing the resources of a single node, such as by adding more CPUs, GPUs, or memory. Scale-Out involves adding more nodes to the system, such as by adding more servers to a cluster. The choice between Scale-Up and Scale-Out depends on a number of factors, including the application, the budget, and the performance requirements. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the Scale-Up and Scale-Out approaches and their use in the context of training a large LLM. The authors of the paper show that a combination of Scale-Up and Scale-Out is often the most effective approach for training a large LLM. The Scale-Up approach can be used to increase the performance of a single node, while the Scale-Out approach can be used to increase the overall performance of the system. The paper also presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of both the Scale-Up and Scale-Out approaches, such as a Multi-Plane Network Topology and a Dual Micro-Batch Overlap technique. These innovations allow the model to be trained more efficiently and to achieve better performance on a wide range of benchmarks [^1228^].

The Scale-Up and Scale-Out approaches are both important for the development of large LLMs. The Scale-Up approach can be used to increase the performance of a single node, which can be useful for applications that require a lot of computation on a single node. The Scale-Out approach can be used to increase the overall performance of the system, which can be useful for applications that require a lot of computation on a large number of nodes. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the Scale-Up and Scale-Out approaches and their use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of both the Scale-Up and Scale-Out approaches.

## 2. Reviewer Role: A Technical Summary and Critique

### 2.1. Core Claims and Contributions

#### 2.1.1. The Central Thesis: Cost-Efficient Scaling via Hardware-Aware Co-Design

The central thesis of the paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" is that **cost-efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) can be achieved through a hardware-aware co-design approach**. The authors argue that the traditional approach of simply increasing the size of LLMs without considering the underlying hardware limitations is no longer sustainable. This is because the "AI memory wall," which refers to the growing gap between the memory capacity of hardware and the memory requirements of large models, is becoming a major bottleneck. To address this challenge, the authors propose a new approach that involves the simultaneous design of both the hardware and the software for a particular application. This approach, which they call "hardware-aware co-design," allows for the optimization of both the hardware and the software for a particular application, which can lead to a significant improvement in efficiency and scalability. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the hardware-aware co-design methodology and its use in the context of training a large LLM. The authors show that the hardware-aware co-design methodology can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs, and they present a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the hardware-aware co-design methodology. These innovations include not only the use of a hardware-aware co-design methodology, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1209^].

The hardware-aware co-design methodology is a key component of the DeepSeek-V3 model, and it is one of the main reasons why the model is so efficient. The hardware-aware co-design methodology is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the traditional design methodology, which means that it can be easily integrated into existing design flows. The hardware-aware co-design methodology is also designed to be highly efficient, as it only requires a small number of additional resources to be used. This is why the hardware-aware co-design methodology is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the hardware-aware co-design methodology and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the hardware-aware co-design methodology.

#### 2.1.2. DeepSeek-V3/R1 Architecture Overview

The DeepSeek-V3/R1 architecture is a large language model (LLM) that was developed by DeepSeek-AI. The model has a total of **671 billion parameters**, but it only activates **37 billion parameters per token**. This is a significant reduction in computational cost compared to a dense model of the same size, which would need to activate all of its parameters for each token. The DeepSeek-V3/R1 architecture is based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which allows for the creation of very large models without a proportional increase in computational cost. The MoE architecture works by dividing the model into a number of smaller "expert" networks, and then using a "gating network" to determine which experts to use for a given input. This allows the model to be much more efficient, as it only needs to activate a small subset of the experts for each input. The DeepSeek-V3/R1 architecture also includes a number of other innovations, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), which is designed to reduce the size of the Key-Value (KV) cache without sacrificing performance. The MLA mechanism works by compressing the key and value vectors into a smaller latent vector, which is then used to compute the attention scores. This can significantly reduce the memory requirements of the KV cache, which can help to alleviate the "AI memory wall" problem [^1211^].

The DeepSeek-V3/R1 architecture was trained on a cluster of **2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs**. The training process used a combination of low-precision training, such as FP8, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which is designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of distributed training of LLMs. The low-precision training technique can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model, with a minimal loss of precision. The Multi-Plane Network Topology works by dividing the network into a number of independent "planes," each of which is responsible for a different part of the communication. This allows the network to be more efficient, as it can avoid congestion and other performance issues that can occur in a traditional network topology. The DeepSeek-V3/R1 architecture has been shown to be highly effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and it has been the foundation for many of the most successful LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3 [^1219^].

The KV cache is a critical component of the Transformer architecture that is used to store the intermediate representations of the input sequence during the attention mechanism. However, the size of the KV cache can grow very quickly, especially for long sequences, which can lead to a number of challenges, including the "AI memory wall." MLA works by compressing the key and value vectors into a smaller latent vector, which is then used to compute the attention scores. This can significantly reduce the memory requirements of the KV cache, which can help to alleviate the "AI memory wall" problem [^1211^].

FP8 mixed-precision training is a training technique that uses a combination of 8-bit floating-point (FP8) and 16-bit floating-point (FP16) or 32-bit floating-point (FP32) arithmetic to train a neural network. The use of FP8 arithmetic can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model, as it requires less memory to store the model's parameters and gradients, and it can be computed more quickly than FP16 or FP32 arithmetic. The Multi-Plane Network Topology is a new network topology that is designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of distributed training of LLMs. The Multi-Plane Network Topology works by dividing the network into a number of independent "planes," each of which is responsible for a different part of the communication.

The DeepSeek-V3 model has a total of 671 billion parameters, but it only activates 37 billion parameters per token. This is a significant reduction in computational cost compared to a dense model of the same size, which would need to activate all of its parameters for each token [^1211^].

#### 3.1.1. Foundational Papers on LLM Architectures

The development of large language models (LLMs) has been a gradual process, with early models like ELMo and BERT paving the way for the more powerful models we see today. The introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 was a major breakthrough, as it enabled the training of much larger and more effective models. Since then, the field has seen a rapid increase in the size and capabilities of LLMs, with models like GPT-3, LLaMA, and DeepSeek-V3 pushing the boundaries of what is possible. This rapid scaling has been driven by a combination of factors, including the availability of larger datasets, more powerful hardware, and new training techniques. However, the increasing size of these models has also led to a number of challenges, including the "AI memory wall," which refers to the growing gap between the memory capacity of hardware and the memory requirements of large models. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" addresses this challenge by introducing a number of innovations, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which are designed to reduce the memory and computational requirements of LLMs without sacrificing performance [^1215^].

The Transformer architecture has undergone a number of modifications and improvements since its introduction. One of the most significant of these is the introduction of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which allows for the creation of much larger models without a proportional increase in computational cost. The MoE architecture works by dividing the model into a number of smaller "expert" networks, and then using a "gating network" to determine which experts to use for a given input. This allows the model to be much more efficient, as it only needs to activate a small subset of the experts for each input. Another important innovation is the use of low-precision training, such as FP8, which can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" builds on these innovations by introducing a number of new techniques, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to further improve the efficiency and scalability of the Transformer architecture [^1215^].

#### 3.1.2. Early Work on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture was first introduced in the 2017 paper "Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer" by Shazeer et al. The MoE architecture was designed to address the challenge of training very large neural networks. The MoE architecture works by dividing the model into a number of smaller "expert" networks, and then using a "gating network" to determine which experts to use for a given input. This allows the model to be much more efficient, as it only needs to activate a small subset of the experts for each input. The MoE architecture has been shown to be highly effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and it has been the foundation for many of the most successful LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MoE architecture and its use in the context of training a large LLM. The authors of the paper present a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the MoE architecture, such as an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective. These innovations allow the model to be trained more efficiently and to achieve better performance on a wide range of benchmarks [^1213^].

The MoE architecture is a key component of the DeepSeek-V3 model, which has a total of 671B parameters but only activates 37B parameters per token. This is a significant reduction in computational cost compared to a dense model of the same size, which would need to activate all of its parameters for each token. The MoE architecture also allows the model to be more scalable, as it is possible to add more experts to the model without a proportional increase in computational cost. This is why the MoE architecture is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the MoE architecture and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the MoE architecture. These innovations include not only an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1217^].

#### 3.1.3. Research on Low-Precision Training

The use of low-precision training, such as FP8, has been a topic of research for many years. The first paper to propose the use of low-precision training was "Mixed Precision Training" by Micikevicius et al., which was published in 2018. The paper showed that it is possible to train a neural network using a combination of 16-bit floating-point (FP16) and 32-bit floating-point (FP32) arithmetic. The use of FP16 arithmetic can significantly reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model, as it requires less memory to store the model's parameters and gradients, and it can be computed more quickly than FP32 arithmetic. However, the use of FP16 arithmetic can also lead to a loss of precision, which can negatively impact the performance of the model. To mitigate this, the paper proposed a number of techniques, such as loss scaling, which can be used to maintain the precision of the model. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" builds on this work by introducing a number of new techniques, such as a tile-wise and block-wise quantization scheme, which can be used to further improve the efficiency and scalability of low-precision training [^1219^].

The use of low-precision training is a key innovation of the DeepSeek-V3 model, and it is one of the main reasons why the model is so efficient. The low-precision training technique is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the standard high-precision training technique, which means that it can be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The low-precision training technique is also designed to be highly efficient, as it only requires a small number of additional resources to be used. This is why the low-precision training technique is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the low-precision training technique and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the low-precision training technique. These innovations include not only the use of a tile-wise and block-wise quantization scheme, but also a number of other techniques, such as a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1220^].

#### 3.1.4. Studies on Hardware-Aware Co-Design

The concept of hardware-aware co-design has been around for many years. The first paper to propose the use of hardware-aware co-design was "Hardware/Software Co-design: Principles and Practice" by De Micheli and Gupta, which was published in 1997. The paper provided a comprehensive overview of the hardware-aware co-design methodology, and it showed how it can be used to design more efficient and effective systems. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" builds on this work by applying the hardware-aware co-design methodology to the design of large language models (LLMs). The authors of the paper have shown that the hardware-aware co-design methodology can be used to design more efficient and scalable LLMs. The authors have also shown that the hardware-aware co-design methodology can be used to reduce the memory and computational requirements of training a model, with a minimal loss of precision. The authors have also shown that the hardware-aware co-design methodology can be used to improve the efficiency and scalability of distributed training of LLMs. The authors have also shown that the hardware-aware co-design methodology can be used to improve the efficiency and scalability of the inference process for LLMs [^1209^].

The hardware-aware co-design methodology is a key innovation of the DeepSeek-V3 model, and it is one of the main reasons why the model is so efficient. The hardware-aware co-design methodology is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the traditional design methodology, which means that it can be easily integrated into existing design flows. The hardware-aware co-design methodology is also designed to be highly efficient, as it only requires a small number of additional resources to be used. This is why the hardware-aware co-design methodology is becoming increasingly popular for the development of large LLMs. The paper "Insights into DeepSeek-V3" provides a detailed analysis of the hardware-aware co-design methodology and its use in the context of training a large LLM, and it presents a number of innovations that are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of the hardware-aware co-design methodology. These innovations include not only the use of a hardware-aware co-design methodology, but also a number of other techniques, such as low-precision training and a Multi-Plane Network Topology, which are designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs [^1228^].
